            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now ſuch a one is a faithfull Chriſtian, and a loyall Subject: but becauſe ſome are like the unjuſt Iudge, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feared God, nor regarded man, <hi>Luke 18.4.</hi> Yet they would bee thought to be faithfull Christians and loyall ſubjects: therefore to make them manifeſt, I ſhall firſt ſhew negatively who they are not, and then I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour affirmatively to ſhew unto you who they are.</p>

It is written, that thou ſhalt not ſpeake evill of the Ruler of thy people, Acts 23.5.</hi> Then thoſe that cannot keep their tongues from ſwearing and their hands from ſtealing, declare plainely how they deſpiſe civill government, and thoſe Lawes that ſhould restraine thoſe curſed practiſes, theſe licentious ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> who ſeek to overthrow civill government by violence. But I ſhall bee more brief in the reſt, becauſe J am but in the Preface.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Romiſh Clergy or the Prelacy are enemies to civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who exempt themſelves from under their power, and not onely ſo, but they ſeek to take the power from the Magiſtrates to themſelves, and ſo to make them their vaſſalls: their cavills I have anſwered diſtinctly in this Booke.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Familiſts</hi> are enemies to civill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, who ſeek to overthrow the eternall Law of God, on which the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Law is built: now if theſe men take away the foundation whereon all our Lawes are built, what doe they elſe in this, but ſeeke to overthrow all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill government, that they may more freely ſatisfie their licentious affections?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> who call themſelves <hi>Independent;</hi> there bee many Sects of them, ſince <hi>Browne</hi> firſt breached that <hi>Schiſme:</hi> ſome follow

               <hi>Smith,</hi> ſome <hi>Iohnſon,</hi> ſome <hi>Robinſon,</hi> ſome <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> but they all daſh one againſt another, and all excommunicate themſelves from the Church of Chriſt: and, ſuith <hi>Pager,</hi> three or four hundred <hi>Browniſts</hi> have brought forth more A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate Anabaptists and Arrians ſometimes in one yeare than ten thouſand members of the Reformed Dutch Church in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> hath done in ten years, though tempted by ſeducers as much as any others: of this he was an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſe, being then and there a member of the Claſſicall Aſſemblies; ſee his Epiſtle to the Arrow againſt the Browniſts. They deny that Magistrates ſhould have any hand in Religion, or the worke of Reformation: they affirme that Christian Princes and Magiſtrates have no more to doe in or about the Church than Heathen Princes: but here they intrench upon civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, denying <hi>Caeſar</hi> his due: thus they would have civill government leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, or limited. The Popiſh Clergy, they would have civill power remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Magiſtrate to themſelves: prophane people would have it conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at, in reſpect of themſelves; and <hi>Antinomians</hi> ſeek the violation of it by accident, in ſeeking to make voyd the Morall Law of God. Yet my purpoſe in writing this book was not to meddle with any of theſe; but as they ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me in the purſuit of thoſe grand enemies of civill government, which are that wicked generation of the <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> theſe are they to whom I chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bend the whole drift of my diſputation, as being abſolute enemies to the eſſentiall being of civill government. It is neither conniving, nor limiting, nor removing that will ſerve their turnes, unleſſe they have an utter extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: ſo then all the rest doe ſome way or other daſh againſt civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but theſe are profeſſed enemies to it. Hence I conclude that none of theſe are the men whom I intend, when, J ſay, they are faithfull Chriſtians, and loyall ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Now J anſwer affirmatively, that thoſe faithfull Chriſtians and loyall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are thoſe people that are faithfull to <hi>Luthers</hi> Proteſtation, and to <hi>Calvins</hi> Jnſtitution: the firſt of theſe was the originall cauſe from whence the name of Proteſtants did firſt ariſe: for when <hi>Luther</hi> did firſt renounce that ſtrumpet of <hi>Rome,</hi> he cauſed them all that were with him to enter into a Proteſtation againſt all Popery, and popiſh Innovations; and all that took it were ever afters wards called Proteſtants: and we in this Kingdome have taken the very ſame Proteſtation againſt all Popery and popiſh Innovations; and I doubt not but we have many amongſt us who will hazzard lives and ſtates and all they have, to maintaine that Protestation, and through Gods mercy will prove themſelves good Proteſtants. Now for <hi>Calvins</hi> Inſtitution, I doe not call it ſo, as if he had made it of his owne head, but as a faithfull ſervant of Ieſus Chriſt, he hath faithfully declared all the counſell of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Acts 20.27.</hi> that all may ſee what a Church Chriſt hath inſtituted in his word, and the

            <p>Dear Chriſtian and loyal ſubject, thou that endevoureſt to have <hi>a conſcience voyd of offence both towards God and towards men, Acts 24.16.</hi> Thou that rendereſt to God his due, and to <hi>Caeſar</hi> his due; thou that obeyeſt both the firſt and ſecond table of the Law, thou that feareſt God, and ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <head>A confutation of the Anabaptiſts and all others who affect not Civill Government, proving the lawfulneſſe of it, and a full anſwer to all their Cavils that are or can be made againſt it.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be two main arguments to prove the lawfulneſſe of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill government amongſt Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Civill government is very neceſſary, and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in many perticulars, ſuch as theſe; It is neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the outward worſhipping of God, and to defend the ſound Doctrine of Godlineſſe, and the ſtate of the Church; and to frame our life to the fellowſhip of men, and to faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our manners to civill righteouſneſſe, and to procure us into Friendſhip one with another, and to nouriſh common peace and quietneſſe. Now while we are here we ſtand in need of ſuch helpes, ſo then the thought of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe Civill Government is outragious cruelty, for we ſtand in as much need of it as of our bread and water, the Sun and the ayre, yea the dignity of it is farre more excellent; for if there were no civill government, men could not live together the outragiouſneſſe of mans nature would be ſo boundleſſe: Againe, if it were not for civill government it were unpoſſible to uphold the true Religion, for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wickedneſſe would ſo abound, as Idolatry and Sacriledge againſt the name of God, and blaſphemies againſt his Truth, and all manner of ſin; <hi>For the man</hi> Micah <hi>had his houſe of Gods; In thoſe daies there was no King in Iſrael, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man did that which was right in his o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ne eies,</hi> Judges 17.5.6. <hi>And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated a Levite to Idolatry, &amp; put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>m in his houſe of God &amp; ſaid, now I know that the Lord will doe me good: In thoſe daies there was no King in Iſrael,</hi> ver. 12.13. chap. 18.1. <hi>The Levites wife played the whore and went from him and was afterwards forced to death: In thoſe daies there was no King in Iſrael,</hi> Chap. 19.1.2.25. <hi>The Children of Iſrael had ſworne ſaying, curſed be he that giveth a wife to</hi> Benjamin, <hi>yet they diſpenced with their Oath and gave their daughters to them:</hi> In thoſe daies there was no King in Iſrael, every man did that which was right in his owne eies, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.18.25. Now the civill government reſtraines all theſe outragious abhominations among the people, that common peace be not diſturbed, that every man may keep his own in ſafety, that men may uſe their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires together without hurt or danger, that honeſty and modeſty may be kept, and that among Chriſtians there may be a profeſſion of religion, and that among men may be a man like civility; So then this Ordinance of policie is to defend the true religion which is contained in the Law of God, that it be not openly and ſacriled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly broken and defiled.</p>
            <p>The ſecond maine ground to prove the lawfulneſſe of civill Government, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the honourable Titles that God is pleaſed to put upon it when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<pb facs="tcp:155189:7"/>it unto us; Thoſe whom it pleaſed God to put in the place of Magiſtrates, they are called Gods, <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods,</hi> Pſal. 82.6. And this is of no ſmall Importance, for thereby is ſignified that they have Commandment from God, and that they are furniſhed with the authority of God, and do altogether bear the perſon of God, whoſe place they doe after a certaine manner ſupply, ſee <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.35. If the Scripture ſaith he <hi>calleth them Gods unto whom the Word of God was given,</hi> which is his word of Command, being a word of Authority; what is this elſe but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cla e that God hath committed his baſineſſe to them, that they ſhould ſerve in his Office as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> ſaid to their Judges, whom they appointed in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very City of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that they ſhould ſit in judgment not for man, but for God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.16. 1 <hi>Cron.</hi> 19.6. And ſo to the ſame purpoſe the wiſedome of God affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>meth by the mouth of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that it is his work that Kings reign, and Princes decree juſtice; <hi>By me Princes rule, and Nobles, and all the Iudges of the earth,</hi> Prov. 8 15.16.</p>
            <p>This plainly declares that the government of all things in earth that is in the hand of Kings and other Rulers, is onely from the Providence and the holy Ordinance of God to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſeemed good ſo to order the matters of men, foraſmuch as he is both preſent and Preſident among them, in making of Lawes, and in executing upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in judgments: This alſo <hi>Paul</hi> affirms &amp; reacheth when he reckoneth Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments among the gifts of God, which being diverſly diſtributed according to the diverſity of grace, and ought to be imployed of the ſervants of Chriſt to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. And although he there properly ſpeaketh of a Counſell of grave men which in the Primitive Church were appointed that they ſhould have the rule of ordering the publique Diſcipline, which Office the Apoſtle calleth Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. Yet foraſmuch as we ſee that the end of civill power tends to the ſame end, therefore we need not doubt but that he commendeth unto us all kinds of Governments, but ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. Where he purpoſely maketh a full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of that matter, for there he ſheweth that <hi>Power is the Ordinance of God,</hi> and that there is no <hi>Powers but they are ordained of God,</hi> and that Princes themſelves are the Miniſters of God, <hi>for a praiſe of them that d e well, and for a terro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doers.</hi> Hence I conclude, that civil Government is a calling not only holy &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful before God, but alſo the moſt holy and moſt honourable calling of all other in the whole life of men; yet ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> on his Commentory on <hi>Iude</hi> page 110. many Libertines ſprung up in the Apoſtles daies, ſuch as <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and his Diſciples, who taught that men might lawfully commit fornication: So alſo the Diſciples of <hi>Baſilides Eunomius,</hi> and the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> Heretikes who taught that men might live as they liſt, ſeeing now ſuch liberty was procured them, being freed from being under the Law any longer, which ſin died not with thoſe curſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, but the Divel hath in theſe laſt daies revived it, eſpecially in 4. ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of men.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Libertines of this age, who hold with the former, that being under grace, they are freed from the obedience of the Law. Secondly the Anabaptiſts, who upon conſideration of the liberty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> that civill Juriſdiction
<pb facs="tcp:155189:7"/>&amp; to Magiſtracie is unlawful, as alſo to make war, and take an Oath before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, theſe (ſaith he) are dangerous enemies whereſoever they be, both to the grace of God, and to the good of men, for where the civill ſword ceaſeth, there can no ſociety ſtand in ſafety. Thirdly, another kind of Libertines are the Papiſts with their whole Religion, being open enemies to the grace of God, turning it into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe and liberty of ſinning againſt him divers waies: Firſt, God having of his grace given unto the Church a power of the keyes to open and ſhut Heaven, but their religion hath turned it into an inſtrument of prophaneneſſe, in ſetting up a new Prieſthood to abſolve and forgive ſins, properly in offering a Sacrifice both for the quick and dead, and ſo aboliſhing the Sacrifice of Chriſt. Secondly, of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, for by it they depoſe Kings and Princes, and they free Subjects from their Allegiance, and they ſtir them up and encourage them to conſpiracies and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they maintaine Factions, Civill Wars and Seditions, and all by vertue of their power. Thirdly, of horrible Covetouſneſſe, by ſelling of pardons for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of years, by which Craft they have gotten the third part of the Revenews of Europe into their hands, which proveth plainly that they turne the grace of God into a liberty of ſinning againſt him.</p>
            <p>The fourth ſort of Libertines, are carnall and formall Proteſtants, who turne the counſell of Gods election into wantonneſſe, ſaying, if I be elected to ſalvation, I ſhall be ſaved, let me live how I will, but if I be not elected, I ſhall not be ſaved, lot me do what I can.</p>
            <p>Secondly they turne the mercy of God into wantonneſſe, in ſaying God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, I will deſer my repentance, for at what time ſoever a ſinner repenteth, God wil put all his ſins out of his remembrance: Therefore they will not repent yet, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what young Saints and old Devils, thus they caſt away the timely acceptance of Gods mercy with a ſcornful reproach.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſome under pretence of brotherly love ſpend all that they have in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, ryot, exceſſe, gameing, and company keeping to the begge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Families.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, others under a pretence that the Jewiſh Sabboth is abbrogated by Chriſt, and now there is no diſtinction of times, hence they will keepe no Sabboth at all.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, ſome others ſay <hi>where ſin abounded, grace abounded much more,</hi> Rom. 5.20. Therefore ſay they, <hi>let us continue in ſin that grace may abound: But all theſe turne the grace of our God into wantonneſſe, and therefore by the juſt judgement of God for committing ſuch things are worthy of death, yet they not only do the ſame, but take pleaſure in them that do them,</hi> R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m. 1.32.</p>
            <p>Now theſe Libertines for the better encouragement of their Diſciples in evil, they tell them they ſhalbe illuminated &amp; deified, ſuch great matters they promiſe them, and by this means make them the children of the Devill ſeven-fold more then they were before: and for the Romiſh Clergy they have been very large in their pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes unto their hearers. They tell them that they ſhalbe able to ſatisfie the juſtice
<pb facs="tcp:155189:8"/>of God for their ſins, yea, and to merit everlaſting life, and not only ſo, but they ſhalbe able to do works of Supererogation, that is, they ſhalbe able to do more then the law of God requires of them, yea, for a little money they ſhall have a tolleration to break any of Gods Commandements, and to reject them at their pleaſure, much like to the old Phariſees, when Gods law ſaid: <hi>He that curſeth father or mother ſhall dye the death;</hi> but theſe men will ſay, although <hi>he honour not his father or his mother he ſhall be free,</hi> Mat 15.46. Theſe <hi>Achans</hi> have a long time troubled our <hi>Iſrael: They neither feare God nor regara man,</hi> Luke 18.4. They deſpiſe all government both of God and man, divine and humane.</p>
            <p>Divine government is the abſolute power of God, whereby he makes lawes to bind the conſcience, and that under pain of life or death eternall; Now this is the power of the whole Trinity, but the adminiſtration of it is committed to the ſonne, this divine law of God is deſpiſed by <hi>Libertines,</hi> or as now they are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and by Anabaptiſts, Papiſts, and prophane Proteſtants, yet at this time I intend not to call them to an account for deſpiſing of that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone, as in it ſelfe, but there is another kind of government deſpiſed of theſe men, which is a humane government, for the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>Submit your ſelves to every ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the King as ſupreame or unto governours ſent by them,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14. This is that government which is ſo much deſpiſed, eſpecially by the Anabaptiſts, to them I chiefly bend the drift of my diſputation, yet not conniving or ſparing any other that ſhall daſh againſt it, or any way ſeem to undervalue it.</p>
            <p>This humane or civill government is a ſtate of ſuperiority conſiſting in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of commanding, and in the power of the ſword for the good of mankind, that it is a ſtate of ſuperiority appeareth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Let every ſoule be ſubject to the higher power.</hi> Again, it conſiſteth in a double power, 1. In commanding, that is, of making laws and edicts, calling and conventing, the ſecond power is that of the ſword, and it may be comprehended under theſce 4. heads, 1. In arreſting, 2. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning, 3. In putting to death, 4. In making warre in way of protection or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why this power of the ſword is added, is this, to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the authority of the magiſtracy, and the authority of the miniſtry: Now this difference ſtandeth in 3. things. Firſt, the magiſtracy hath a power in it ſelfe, whereby the civill Magiſtrate may command in his owne name, but the Miniſtry hath power only to pronounce what God commandeth, and in his name ſaying; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, none durſt ever ſay from himſelfe, I ſay unto you, but Chriſt alone,</hi> Math. 5.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the authority of the civill Magiſtrate is in himſelfe, but the authority of the Miniſter is not in himſelfe, but in Chriſt, ſo then the civill Magiſtrate may command obedience to himſelfe, but the Miniſter commandeth it to God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the civill Magiſtrate hath power over the outward man, but the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath power only to counſell, perſwade and exhort. So much of the difference
<pb facs="tcp:155189:8"/>between the Magiſtracy and the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this power of the ſword is added to diſtinguiſh the power of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy from all private power, as in Schooles and Families, which have a power of commanding, but not of the ſword.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I adde for the common good of mankind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. He is the Miniſter of God to thee for good, or for thy wealth, that is in procuring the welfare of ſoule and body, which ſtandeth in two things, Firſt, true Religion, Secondly, civill ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, both which are by the magiſtracy maintained,</p>
            <p>Now here it may be demanded, how farre the power of civill government rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth. I anſwer, over all cauſes, things, and words of men, whether Civil, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, over Temporall things. I know none that will make queſtion of it, but the Anabaptiſts, who deny the very being of it, but it alſo reacheth to the cauſes of the Church, and this appeareth in that the Kings muſt have the booke of the Law before them when they ſit upon the Throne of the Kingdome, and it muſt be with them, and they muſt read therein all the dayes of their lives, that they may learne <hi>to feare the Lord their God, and that they may keep all the words of this law, and do them, that their heart be not lifted up above their brethren,</hi> Deut. 17.18.19.20.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this we may ſee in many examples of holy Kings in Scripture, <hi>Ioſiah kept the Paſſeover and commanded others to keep it,</hi> 2 Chron. 35.1.16. and K. <hi>Aſa</hi> commanded <hi>Iudah to ſeek the Lord God of their fathers, and to doe the Law and the commandement, and he took away the Altars of the ſtrange Gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves,</hi> 2 Chr. 14.3.4. <hi>And</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>repaired the Altar of the Lord, and ſacrificed thereon Peace-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and commanded</hi> Judah <hi>to ſerve the Lord,</hi> Chap. 33.16. <hi>And</hi> Joſiah <hi>tooke away all the abhominations out of all the Countreys that pertained to the children of Iſrael, and he made all that was preſent to ſerve the Lord their God,</hi> Cha. 34.33. <hi>Iſrael ſerved the Lord all the dayes of</hi> Joſhuah, <hi>and all the dayes of the Elders that out-lived</hi> Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But heare the Schiſme of <hi>Brownie,</hi> thoſe independant people will ſet upon mee, who tell us that Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates have no more to doe in or about the Church then heathen Princes; I anſwer, but every faithfull Subject under a Chriſtian Prince will acknowledge his place is to defend the ſaith, I mean the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith, all thoſe truths which are neceſſary to be believed to ſalvation they are to defend, that no hereſie as a canker may corrupt, as alſo the written word of God, which is called the word of faith, becauſe by it faith is wrought in the Elect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. this faith they muſt defend alſo: But they object, that thoſe Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> mentioned before, who medled in the Church with Reformation and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of Religion, that they did it not as Kings, but as Types of Chriſt, ſo that now Chriſt is come, he hath put an end to all ſuch Types and Shadowes; but this is a wicked errour for us to exclude any perticular calling that is lawfull, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch an eminent calling as that of the Magiſtracy, from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ſwell as now.</p>
            <p>I once demanded of ſome of the chiefe of them in that way what Chriſt was to the Church of the Jewes, if not their King while thoſe Reformers were living, but I was never anſwered yet: But what ſaith the Lord, <hi>I have ſet my King upon the hill of Sion,</hi> Pſal. 2.6. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord</hi> (ſaith King <hi>David</hi>) Pſal. 110.1. Yea before the Law was given <hi>when</hi> Abraham <hi>ſate in his Tent doore, he lift up his eyes and looked, and loe three men ſtood before him,</hi> but one of them was Chriſt, for (ſaid he) <hi>My Lord if now I have found favour in thy ſight, paſſe not away I pray thee from thy ſervant,</hi> Gen. 18.2.3. <hi>The other two were angels which went to</hi> Sodom, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.1. He appeared often, as to <hi>Iacob Gen.</hi> 32.24.28. &amp; <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.20. <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 5.14.15. He is called the King of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and wiſedome which is Chriſt ſaith, <hi>By me Kings reigne, and Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree juſtice; By me Princes rule and Nobles, yea all the Iudges of the earth,</hi> Pro. 8.12.15.16. So that then Kings were Gods Deputies on earth aſwel as now: But will they debar that honourable calling of the Magiſtracy from having any
<pb facs="tcp:155189:9"/>hand in the worke of Reformation of Religion under the Goſpell, how will they anſwer ſuch places as theſe, <hi>They ſhall bring thy ſons in their Armes and thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhall be carried upon their ſhoulders, and Kings ſhall be thy nurſing Fathers, and Queenes ſhal be thy nurſing Mothers,</hi> Iſa. 49.22.23. And ſaith <hi>Paul, pray for Kings, and all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſſe and honeſty,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.1.2. Then muſt we pray that Kings and thoſe in authority may be a meanes to help us to lead a peaceable, quiet, honeſt and godly life, and then ſay preſently that they have no more to governe us in a godly life, than heathen Princes, but Kings muſt read <hi>in the Law of God all the dayes of their life, that they may learne to feare the Lord their God, and keep all the words of this Law, and doe them,</hi> Deut. 17.10 19. If this doth not ſatisfie, ſee one place more, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.3, <hi>The God of Iſrael ſaid, the Rock of Iſrael ſpeake to me he that ruleth over men muſt be juſt,</hi> and not only ſo, <hi>but ruling in the feare of God.</hi> If this ſufficeth not, let them ſhew whem or where any lawfull calling was debard from the work of Reformation, if they cannot, then why ſhould this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable calling be excluded? We may read of many callings that put to their hand in repairing the walls of Jeruſalem, which was a Type of the Church, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, Goldſmiths, Merchants and others, and Rulers that put their hand to the worke, and commended but their Nobles, are branded for this, <hi>that they put not their necks to the worke of the Lord,</hi> ſee <hi>Nehem.</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <p>I grant that Miniſters are to informe the Church what is the will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Reformation but the Church and People are to doe it in obedience to Gods Commandment, and the commandment of the Magiſtrate, ſee both theſe <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.14. theſe were heathen Kings, and were they alſo Types of Chriſt: Again, ſhall heathen Princes have their hand in the worke of Reformation, and ſhall Chriſtian Kings be barred from it, ſhall thoſe without the Covenant and without Grace doe it, and ſhall not Chriſtian Kings and Magiſtrates being in the Covenant and in the ſtate of grace doe it? thoſe that are not blind may ſee their folly.</p>
            <p>In the next place it wil be demanded whether Magiſtrates have the ſame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Eccleſiaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icall things as in Civill: I anſwer, no, there be two differences to be marked; Firſt in civill cauſes it ordereth all, and executeth all, but in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call it hath power to order al, but not to execute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Magiſtrate indeed ordereth and preſcribeth an all, but the Min ſter is he that executeth in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes. Secondly, Civill Authority hath power over all the things of men, as their words and actions, body and goods, but not over the things of God, as the Word and Sacraments, Faith and Conſcience, and all the graces of Gods ſpirit wrought in the heart, civill power hath no rule over theſe, for (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Give unto God the things of God and unto</hi> Ceſar <hi>the things of</hi> Ceſar. Secondly, this authority ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eth to all ſorts of perſons, as well Eccleſiaſticall as Civill, but ſo as it reacheth not beyond the out ward man, it's to the body life, converſation &amp; outward things, but not to the ſoul &amp; conſcience of which God is the only Lord &amp; governour: Now if it be demanded how many kinds of Civill Government there be, I anſwer, it is of
<pb facs="tcp:155189:10"/>three ſorts, firſt in one perſon, which is a Monarchie. 2. In more then one, when the government is in a few States and Peeres, this may be called Ariſtocrificall. or a Parliamentary way of government. 3. When it lyes in the body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, this is called a popular governement by one of theſe three is every Common-wealth governed.</p>
            <p>Here I need not to diſpute which of theſe is the beſt kind of government for a Chriſtian Common-wealth to be governed by. I ſuppoſe a populer government is the way to ſedition and to Civill wars, and mutinies in a Common-wealth, and Monarchiall would be a very heavy burden for a free Nation to beare, when <hi>Rehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> told them he would make their yoake heavy, and whip them with Scorpions, he almoſt loſt all his Subjects. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.14. Then I conceive a Parliamentary way of government to be moſt agreeable to Gods word, and moſt comfortable &amp; beneficiall to all the people, when the three States are aſſembled, the King entring a Covenant with the Lords and Commons, repreſenting the whole body of the land: <hi>Thus all the Elders of Iſrael came to</hi> Hebron, <hi>and</hi> David <hi>made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them in</hi> Hebron <hi>before the Lord, and they annoynted</hi> David <hi>King over all Iſrael,</hi> 1 Chro. 11.3. <hi>And when</hi> Joaſh <hi>was annoynted King, all the chiefe of the Fathers of</hi> Iſrael <hi>came to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and all the Congregation made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the King in the houſe of God,</hi> 2 Chron. 23.2, 3. Now this Covenant between the King and the repreſentative body of the Kingdome bindes all in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſee <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 9.18, 19.20. What the Princes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> then did, if <hi>Saul</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a King, and many hundred of years after, ſhall preſume to breake this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, his houſe and Kingdome ſhall ſinart for it, ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. Nay, although the covenanting with thoſe people was a ſinne, and many of the people murmured at it, yet it being made, muſt not be broken, which doth at this time charge us all to be under this Nationall Covenant, conſidering the repreſentative body of the Land have ſolemnly taken it, although ſome refractory people refuſe it and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at it, yet this wil not free any from obſerving of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.14, 15.</p>

I anſwer, that is meant in our communication, which muſt be <hi>Yea, yea, and nay, nay v</hi> 37. Again, God commands ſwearing as a part of his worſhip, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God, and ſerve him, and ſhale ſweare by his name,</hi> Deuteron. 6.13. &amp; 10.20. Now Chriſt came to do the will of his Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.30. And not to contradict it as our Anabaptiſts blaſphemouſly affirme, while they ſay, Chriſt here flatly forbids ſwearing, which was commanded by God as a part of his worſhip: but ſee how theſe wicked people would make a breach of Unity in the very Trinity betweene God the Father, and God the Son; then wel may theſe blaſphemers make rents and diviſions in Kingdomes and Common wealths. Again, the Apoſtle is ſo far from denying the lawful uſe of ſwearing, that hee gives a ſufficient reaſon to prove the lawfulneſſe of it in ſome caſes for ſaith he <hi>men verily ſweare by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is the end of all ſtrife,</hi> Heb. 6.16. Again, we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples of them that have ſworn upon ſome occaſions, both out of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament and out of the New, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.23.31.53. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.31. This may ſuffice to prove that ſwearing in ſome caſes is lawfull.</p>
            <p>Now to know what an oath is, we ſhall ſee by the parts of it, which are two, Confeſſion and Imprecation: Confeſſion is threefold, though for the outward forme the words be few: Firſt, a man confeſſeth that which he ſweareth to be true
<pb facs="tcp:155189:11"/>in his conſcience. 2. That God is a witneſſe not of his outward action and ſpeech, but alſo of his particular conſcience. 3. That God is an omnipotent Judge of all, and of him that ſweareth, and able to juſtifie him if he ſweare truly, or otherwiſe to condemne him eternally if he ſweare falſly, theſe things are confeſſed by him that ſweareth.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing in an oath is Imprecation, which is a prayer to God for two things. 1. That God would be witneſſe with him that ſweareth, to teſtifie that hee ſweareth truly, and according to his conſcience, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. <hi>I ſpeak the truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my conſcience bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> 2. a man prayes that God would become a Judge to curſe him with eternall wrath, if he ſweare falſly, thus did <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. I call God to record upon my ſoule; and the forme of ſwearing in old time was the uſing of this imprecation, <hi>God doe ſo to me, and more alſo if I do not thus and thus,</hi> 2 Kings 6.31. Thus you ſee what an oath is: Now it may be demanded, when be the times, and in what caſes we may lawfully ſweare, ſeeing we may not ſweare in our communication.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, a man may lawfully ſweare, when the Magiſtrate miniſtreth an oath unto a man upon a juſt occaſion, for the Magiſtrate hath the power of God in this caſe, and therefore when he juſtly requires it of a man, then he may lawfully ſwear.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when a mans own calling generall or particular, neceſſarily requires an oath, and that in foure caſes, 1. When the taking of an oath ſerveth to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, procure, or win unto God any part of his glory, or to preſerve the ſame from diſgrace, in this regard <hi>Paul</hi> moved with a godly zeale, uſed an oath for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Doctrine, that the Churches to whom he writ, might be eſtabliſhed in the truth, and ſo glorifie God the more.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when his oath ſerveth to maintain or further his own or others ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or preſervation in ſoule or body, in this caſe <hi>Paul</hi> calls God for a record unto his ſoule, that he came not to <hi>Corinth</hi> to ſpare them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. And <hi>David</hi> to further himſelfe in the way of ſalvation bound himſelf by an oath that he would keepe Gods Commandements, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.106.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when the oath ſerves to confirme and eſtabliſh peace and ſociety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween party and party, countrey and countrey, Kingdome and Kingdome: <hi>Thus did</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Abimilech <hi>ſweare each to other,</hi> Gen. 21.23. <hi>And</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Laban, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.53. And by vertue hereof do Subjects binde themſelves by oath in Allegiance to their Princes, and ſouldiers to their Generalls.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, when a man by oath may free himſelfe, and can no otherwiſe from tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall loſſes, or procure to himſelfe ſome temporall benefits which be of great weight and moment, then do men take an oath for confirmation to put an end to all ſtrife, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. <hi>For much ſtrife and contention ariſeth about worldly affairs,</hi> and in this regard, a man by oath may purge himſelfe lawfully from infamy and ſlander: in theſe four caſes a man may lawfully ſwear, not only before the Magiſtrate, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo privately, ſo it be with due reverence and good conſcience, but in common talke or on light occaſions, a man cannot lawfully ſweare, either by great or ſmall oaths,
<pb facs="tcp:155189:11"/>for that it is to take the name of God in vaine.</p>
            <p>Secondly it may be demanded, how muſt a man take an oath, when he is by a juſt occaſion called to ſwear? I anſwer, there be three vertues or ingredients in an oath, which muſt not be wanting, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſweare, the Lord liveth in truth, in judgment, and in righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, truth, and that reſpecteth 2. things, 1. The matter whereto we ſwear, for God may not be brought for a witneſſe to a lye, 2. It muſt be in truth, according to the mind of him that ſweareth without fraud or deceit, and with intent to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that truly which he promiſeth thereupon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt ſweare in righteouſneſſe, which alſo reſpecteth two things, firſt the thing ſworn to, that muſt be juſt and lawfull, and according to Gods word: ſecondly, the conſcience of the ſweater, for a man muſt not ſweare for a trifle, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the thing be true, but either by authority of the Magiſtrate, or upon ſome neceſſary cauſe of his lawfull calling, and againſt this vertue do thoſe ſinne that ſweare uſually in their common talke, though the thing be true, for trifles and light matters are not a juſt cauſe of an oath.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we ought to ſwear in judgement, that is, he that ſweareth rightly, ought to know the nature of an oath, and be able to judge of the matter before whom, and to whom,, and of time and place, and other circumſtances, and for his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he that ſweareth, ought to ſee in his own conſcience that he is fit to take an oath, and thereby to worſhip and glorifie God; for he that ſweareth aright, ought to have his heart ſmitten with feare and awe toward God, as in all other parts of his worſhip, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.20. <hi>The feare of God and ſwearing are joyned together,</hi> &amp; therefore a prophane man that hath no feare of God in his heart, ought not to ſweare, this may ſuffice our Anabaptiſts concerning the lawfull uſe of ſwearing, eſpecially that oath of Allegiance to Princes, wherein they are bound in ſubjection to Civill government which they deſpiſe, and ſo much for their firſt objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the lawfull uſe of Civill government.</p>
            <p>Their ſecond objection, they ſay that ſubjection came in with ſin, but (ſay they) Chriſt hath taken away ſin, and therefore he hath taken away ſubjection alſo: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, they ſay that man in innocency was to <hi>rule over the fiſh in the ſea, the fowels of heaven, and over the beaſts on the earth, and all creeping things,</hi> but not over man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. But after the fall <hi>Eve</hi> is put under ſubjection to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. To this I anſwer, that there be two kinds of ſubjection, the firſt is ſervile, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond civill; the former is the ſubjection of a ſlave or vaſſal, who is onely to ſeeke the proper good of his Lord and Maſter, the latter is that whereby one man is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to another for the common good, the firſt of theſe came in by ſin, but the ſecond was before ſin, even in innocency, and ſo <hi>Eve</hi> was ſubject to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency; and the Apoſtle argueth thus, <hi>Let the woman be ſubject to the man, for ſhee was taken out of man; for the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.8.9. <hi>Let the woman learn in ſilence with all ſubjection; I ſuffer not a woman to uſurpe
<pb facs="tcp:155189:12"/>authority over the man, for</hi> Adam <hi>was firſt formed</hi> then <hi>Eve,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.11.12, 13. Now this was in their innocency that the woman was taken out of man, &amp; that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had the priority in creation, <hi>&amp; woman was made a help meet for man,</hi> Ge. 218. Therfore ſhe was ſubject in the time of innocency: Again, in the time of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it was ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d, <hi>increaſe and multiply,</hi> therfore by the light of nature there is a plain diſtinction between the father and the ſonne, the one to rule, the other to obey, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obedience is due to Magiſtrates: Again, they miſ-alledg that place <hi>Gen</hi> 1.26, becauſe it was ſpoken not of man alone, but of all mankind, which comprehends aſwell women as men, for all mankind without exception had dominion over the veſt of unreaſonable creatures; and for the ſecond place <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>He ſhal rule, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d thou ſhalt be ſubject;</hi> this is not ſpoken as if ruling &amp; ſubjection were not before the fall, but becauſe now ſubjection is joyned with feare, griefe and ſorrow, this is that curſe that came in by ſin, and was not in innocency, for then ſubjection was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull and full of pleaſure; So then ſubjection it ſelfe is not a curſe, but as feare, and griefe and ſorrow are joyned with it; then let us make our ſubjection to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates a pleaſure, and ſo the curſe is taken off, and we ſhall enjoy the bleſſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.2.3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly they object, that every beleever is in the Kingdome of Heaven even in this life; and further, they ſay in Heaven there is no King but God, therfore belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are to be ſubject to none but God and Chriſt: I anſwer, there be two kinds of Government upon earth, one is ſpirituall and inward, this is called the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven that is within you, which ſtandeth in <hi>righte usneſſe, peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and joy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 14.17. In regard of this government of Chriſt there is no difference, of bond and free, Maſter and Servant, Father and Sonne, <hi>for all are one in Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.28. But the other is actuall Government, wherein orders and diſtinctions of men muſt be maintained, as ſome muſt be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſome muſt be Subjects, ſome Fathers, ſome children, ſome Maſters, ſome ſervants: hence every man ought to ſuſtaine two perſons, and is to be conſidered firſt as a believer, and a member of the Kingdome of Chriſt thus he is equall to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beleever, and any beleever is equall to him. Secondly, he muſt be conſidered as a member of the Common-wealth wherein he liveth, thus he is either a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or an Inferiour, ſo then their reaſon were to ſome purpoſe if every beleever were only in the Kingdome of Heaven but every one that liveth here is alſo a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſome Common-wealth, ſo that he muſt either be a Magiſtrate to rule others, or elſe hee muſt be ſubject, and obedient to others whom the Lord hath appointed to rule them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they object that civill Government is full of cruelty, which having the ſword in their hand, they deſtroy the bodyes and ſoules of offenders in not giving them time of repentance, and therefore is intolerable among Chriſtians: I anſwer, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Levites</hi> by Gods commandement flew 3000. of the Iſraelites for worſhipping the golden Calfe, and never gave them ſpace to repent. Secondly, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors that are not moved to repentance under the ſentence of preſent death, there
<pb facs="tcp:155189:12"/>is little hope that ever they will repent although they had longer time allowed to them. Thirdly, Gods wiſedome and commandement muſt take place of mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but he commandeth that the malefactor ſhould dye, that thereby the evill may be taken away; then better it is that one ſhould be deſtroyed then unity; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that one be removed then a multitude by the contagion of his example ſhould be infected, therfore civill government is neceſſary, and ought to be obeyed.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, they object many places of Scripture, ſuch as theſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Stand faſt in the liberty wherin Chriſt hath ſet you free,</hi> from this they plead that they are freed by Chriſt from all obedience to Magiſtrates: I anſwer, the liberty which Chriſt hath procured us, is liberty of conſcience, and freedome from the power of ſin, Satan, death, hell and condemnation and therfore ſpirituall, but not from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall or civill ſubjection.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, from <hi>Ram.</hi> 13.8. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>owe nothing to any man but love,</hi> therefore ſay they, no obedience or ſubjection: I anſwer, there be two kinds of debts, 1. a civil debt occaſioned by contract and bargaining between man and man, the ſecond is a debt to which we are all bound by Gods commandement, Law or Covenant; but this place is to be underſtood of the firſt of theſe ſo far as lies in our power, but we are bound ſtill in ſubjection and obedience to the latter, and beſides in this word love is comprehended all manner of duty whatſoever, therefore love is the fulfilling of the whole Law: For as love to God includes obedience, ſo doth love to man the ſame.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.26. Where Chriſt had demanded before <hi>of whom the Kings of the earth take tribute, whether of his owne Children or of ſtrangers, and</hi> Peter <hi>anſwered, of ſtrangers, to which Chriſt replied, then are the children free;</hi> From hence they would gather, that there is no ſubjection due to Magiſtrates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Kings Sonnes are freed from paying Tribute: To this I anſwer, that Chriſt here ſpeaketh of himſelfe, who was by his birth the heire of the Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Jewes, and therefore by right was to pay none, neither did he but to avoid offence, but how doth this free othermen from their obecie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to Magiſtrates?</p>
            <p>Eighthly, from theſe words of <hi>Paul, Yee are bought with a price, be yee not the ſervants of man</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23. I anſwer the Apoſtle here doth not free ſervants from their ſubjection and obedience to them that are their Maſters, for (ſaith he) <hi>Servants obey in all things your Maſters according to the fleſh,</hi> Col. 3.22. But they muſt not make them abſolute Lords over their ſoules and Conciences, and the graces of Gods ſpirit in them, theſe are the things of God; Now, if our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience move us to obedience, it muſt be from Gods commandement and not from mans <hi>for ye ſerve the Lord Chriſt therefore do it heartily;</hi> but mark how, <hi>as to the Lord, and not to men,</hi> Col. 3.23 24.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, they object from theſe words of Chriſt ſaving, <hi>The Kings of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles exerciſe Lordſhip over them and they that exerciſe authority are called benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors but ye ſhall not be ſo,</hi> Luke 22.25. But what of this, here was a ſtrife among the Diſciples which of them ſhould be accounted the greateſt, and Chriſt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<pb facs="tcp:155189:13"/>their ambition, told them that their miniſtery was not like to Kingdomes in which one man hath preheminence above the reſt; but how doth this place hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Magiſtrates of that ſubjection which is due unto them? It is cleare from hence, that although the miniſtry ſhould be equall, that one ſhould not exalt himſelfe above another, yet it ought to be ſo in Kingdomes, therefore civill Government is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable and lawfull.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, they object, that beleevers are governed by the ſpirit of God, and ſo are able to governe themſelves every way, and need not any government of man: I anſwer, it is one thing what we doe, and another thing what we ought to doe, we ought indeed ſo to live as not to need any governours, but we doe not live ſo, yea if beleevers could live ſo, yet were the reaſon nought, for the viſible Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines as well bad as good, hypocrites as well as ſincere Chriſtians, and therefore the beſt Churches ſtand in need of Magiſtracy for the puniſhment of evill doers, &amp; for the praiſe of them that do well, yea the Church lying open to the malice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and wicked men, ſtandeth ever in need of Magiſtracy to protect it by force, or warre, or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, they object that all Chriſtians by the law of God are forbidden to kill, and ſaith the Lord, ſpeaking of theſe times under the Goſpell, <hi>that they ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy mountaines,</hi> Iſa 11.9. I anſwer, Magiſtrates in executing juſtice, do not do it of themſelves, but as they are Deputies to the Lord, they do but execute his will; <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> ſaid to the Judges, <hi>take heed what you do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 19.6. Then they doing all things by Gods authority, <hi>they ought not to beare the ſword in vaine,</hi> Rom. 13.4. Therefore <hi>David</hi> rehearſeth this among the vertues of a King: <hi>To cut off the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the Land, and all the workes of iniquity from the Citie of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 101. This made <hi>Moſes</hi> to forget his meekneſſe, and <hi>David</hi> his gentleneſſe, to doe the juſtice of the Lord: The King that ſitteth on the throne of judgement, ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his eyes over every evill man. Again, <hi>a wiſe King ſcattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them</hi> Pro. 20.8.26. <hi>Take away the wicked from before the Throne, and the Throne ſhal be eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe: An evill man ſeeketh only rebellion, therefore a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him,</hi> Pro. 16.12.17.11. Thus you ſee that magiſtrates may cut off malefactors by death, and yet be free from ſpilling blood, or the breach of that Commandement, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill:</hi> Nay, it is their righteouſneſſe to cut off the guilty malefactor, and by ſo doing, they do keep their own hands pure from the blood that thoſe murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers have ſhed, and on the contrary if they do not, they are guilty of moſt horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wickedneſſe, yet a Magiſtrate muſt take heed that hee doth neither with rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſſe of mind wound them that he ſhould heale, nor with a ſuperſtitious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of clemency, fall into moſt cruell gentleneſſe.</p>
            <p n="12">12. But they object, that under the Goſpell Chriſtians ſhall turne their ſwords into Plough ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning hookes: <hi>Nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn warre any more,</hi> Iſa 2.4. To this I
<pb facs="tcp:155189:13"/>have given a large anſwer in that book intituled <hi>the Saints Inheritance after the day of judgement,</hi> when the Saints ſhall inherit all things: but till the day that Chriſt ſhall come to judgment? wars ſhall never ceaſe, they ſhall fall by the edge of the ſword, but when ſhall this be? ſurely very neare the end when there be ſignes in the Sun, Moon, and Stars, then they ſhall ſee the Son of Man in a cloud with power and great glory, but what of this? I anſwer, when ye ſee theſe things come to paſſe, know ye that the kingdome of God is nigh at hand, <hi>Lu</hi> 21.24.25.27.31. Now will you know when wars ſhall ceaſe? I anſwer, when the Son of Man ſhall come with power, and great glory, then is that Kingdome of God at hand, in which there ſhalbe no wars, but then all that offend ſhalbe gathered out of his Kingdome, and caſt into the furnace of fire, and the righteous ſhall ſhine as the ſun in the Kingdome of their Father, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.41, 42, 43. Then wars ſhall ceaſe when there ſhalbe none in that Kingdome that offends, but theſe offenders muſt be in the Church, till the very judgement day at the end of the world: The Angels which are the Reapers, ſhall take out thoſe tares that did offend, and caſt them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell fire; then ſhall the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> reſtore to the Saints all the creatures in their firſt perfection, after that they are purified by fire, at that day the Saints ſhall inherit all things, and not before: For the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by ſin brought vanity and corruption upon all the creatures, but at that day the creatures ſhalbe purified and purged from their vanity and corruption, and then reſtored to the Saints alone, &amp; ſo they ſhall remain for ever; for the Second <hi>Adam</hi> wil reſtore againe to the Saints all that they loſt, and not as they are now corrupted &amp; cloathed with vanity: <hi>For the new heavens and the new earth which I will make, ſhall remain before me, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Iſa 66.22. <hi>Of that Kingdome there ſhalbe no end,</hi> Luke 1.33. Now becauſe the Church ſhalbe peſtered with many enemies till the day of judgement, the ſword of the Magiſtrate is neceſſary to keep down the ſeditious ſtirs of unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et men, which trouble all Kingdomes with violent oppreſſions and hainous evill doings, then Magiſtrates ought to defend them that are troubled, and to preſerve the lawes &amp; diſcipline with purity, which is the only means to regulate ſuch wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men to better obedience; ſhall Theeves that rob a few be puniſhed, and ſhall they ſuffer whole Countreys to be ſpoiled with robberies; ſo then the chiefe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is not only to ſuppreſſe private injuries with judiciall puniſhments, but alſo muſt defend with war the Dominions committed to his charge againſt any forraign invaſion whatſoever, and ſuch wars by the teſtimony of Scripture in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places are lawfull.</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, they object that in the new Teſtament is neither witneſſe nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample which teacheth that war is a thing lawfull for Chriſtians: I anſwer, the ſame rule that was to the Jewes remaines ſtill for Chriſtians, and there can be no cauſe to the contrary why Magiſtrates ſhould not now defend Chriſtians aſwel as they did the Jewes. Secondly, we ſhould not look for a full declaration of theſe things in the writings of the Apoſtles, for their purpoſe was not to frame a Civill State, but to eſtabliſh and to ſettle the ſpirituall Kingdome of Chriſt. Thirdly, if
<pb facs="tcp:155189:14"/>Chriſt had intended that wars ſhould end at his comming, he would have ſaid to thoſe Souldiers which demanded of him ſaying, <hi>what ſhall we doe?</hi> Luke 3.14. I ſay his anſwer would have been this, caſt away your weapons, and utterly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your ſelves from war, but he ſhewes no diſlike of their being Souldiers, only he counſels theat to <hi>be content with thear wages, and to doe violence to no man;</hi> yet by the way, I approve not of every light-occaſion to be ground ſufficient to goe to wars, unleſſe they be driven to it by extreathe neceſſity: For as <hi>Cicero,</hi> a heathen man ſaid, our going to war ſhould tend to peace, for war ſhould be ſought onely, when no other meanes will procure peace: Laſtly they ought not to goe to warre upon any private affection, but as they are ſenſible of ſome injury do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which they are charged to keepe in peace, for if any private affection ſhould move them for wars, they abuſe the power committed to them; which was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them for their owne Commodity, but for their Kingdomes benefit; thus they may uſe Garriſons and Fortifications to defend the borders of their Countries, and if any trouble ariſe, they may joyne their Forces together to ſuppreſſe the common Enemy which would ſpoile their Kingdome, which they are charged to keepe in peace and ſafety.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle compares the fight of faith, that ſpirituall combate the child of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> corruptions, to the bodily fight with open enemies to the Church of Chriſts which ſhewes the lawfulneſſe of wars undertaken by Chriſtians for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Religion, <hi>now the good ſouldier muſt give himſelfe wholly to it, and ſtrive lawfully, and he ſhall be crowned</hi> 2 Tim. 3 4 5. And we read of rare Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that were Souldiers, the Centurion had ſouldiers under him, and yet <hi>he had ſuch a ſaith, the like was not found in Iſrael,</hi> Mat. 8.9.10. <hi>And</hi> Cornelius <hi>was a devout man, and a Captain of the Italian Band, and he had devout ſouldiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him,</hi> Acts 10.1.2.7. <hi>And</hi> Paul <hi>was guarded by a Band of ſouldiers,</hi> Acts 23.23.24. We read that <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> will compaſſe the Campe of the Saints, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.8.9. But what, ſhall not this Camp of Saints reſiſt them? <hi>I ſaw the Beaſt and the Kings of the Earth, and their Armies gathered together to make war againſt him that ſate on the horſe,</hi> (marke) <hi>and againſt his Army, and the Beaſt was taken,</hi> Revel. 19.19.20. But what, was this done without any fight? did this Army of Chriſtians, and this Camp of Saints ſtand all for cyphers? You ſhall ſee <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> compaſſed about with Armies, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. <hi>And there ſhall be warres, for all theſe things muſt come to paſſe,</hi> Mar. 24.6. It is ſpoken indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, that if one King goe to war with another, they ought to withſtand him if they be able, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.31. As we would doe againſt a thiefe, <hi>and not ſuffer our houſe to be broken up,</hi> Mat. 24.43. (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I came to ſend fire on the earth, &amp; it is already kindled,</hi> Luke 12.49. <hi>I came not to ſend peace, but a ſword,</hi> Mat. 10.34. Then <hi>he that hath no ſword, let him ſell his garment and buy one,</hi> Luke 22.36. <hi>And reſiſt unto bloud,</hi> Heb. 12.4. Then thoſe that thinke their lives too deare for Chriſt and his Goſpell, are unworthy of either, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.35. &amp; ill members both to Church and State.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:155189:14"/>
            <p> Hence we may gather, that if this be ſo, then Tributes and Taxes are lawfull Revenues for Princes, which they may chiefly imploy to ſuſtaine their common charges of their Office, and likewiſe uſe to their private Royalty and honour of their Princely ſtate and dignity, as wee may ſee by the examples of many holy Kings in Scripture, which according to the State of their perſons which they did beare, were ſumptuouſly maintained of the common charge, and we read in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48.21. <hi>That there was a very large portion of land aſſigned to the King, &amp;c.</hi> Yet again Princes ſhould remember, that their treaſure chambers are not ſo much their owne private coffers, as the Treaſuries of the whole People; therfore ſaith <hi>Paul, For this cauſe pay we tribute, for they are Gods Miniſters, attending conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually upon this very thing, to execute wrath upon him that doth evill, and he is the Miniſter of God to thee for good, render therefore tribute to whom tribute is due,</hi> Rom. 13. So then they may not prodigally waſte and ſpoile what they are betru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with, for if they doe, it is manifeſt wrong to the people; nay it is no leſſe then moſt cruelly and unnaturally ſpilling the bloud of the people, for their Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Subſidies, and other kind of tributes are but the ſupports of publique neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: Then to weary the poore Communalty without cauſe, is tyrannicall extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, theſe things conſidered, doe not encourage Princes to waſtefull expence and ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, but rather it behoveth them with pure conſcience before God to doe all that they are bound to dee, leſt by their wicked boldneſſe they be deſpiſed of God; and they muſt be raught by them to whom it belongs, how much is lawfull for them, neither is this Doctrine needleſſe for private men, they muſt not raſhly and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly give themſelves leave to grudge at the expences of Princes, although they exceed common and civill meaſure, ſee <hi>Calvin Inſti.</hi> 4.20.13.</p>
            <p>Here it may be demanded by what rule Civill Government is to be regulated: I anſwer, by the Civill and poſitive Lawes of that Kingdome from which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their authority and dignity of civill Magiſtrates, theſe Lawes are as ſtrong ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of Common-weales, or as <hi>Cicero</hi> calleth them, the ſoules, without which the Magiſtrate cannot ſtand, neither have they without the Magiſtrate any force, for the Law may be called a dumb Judge, and the Magiſtrate a living Law.</p>
            <p>Now the Jewes had three ſorts of Lawes, the Ceremoniall, which was to them a darke Goſpell, ſhewing forth Chriſt to them in darke Types and ſhadows, but bleſſed be God, the vaile is taken away to us, and Chriſt is more clearly ſet forth to us ſince the publication of the Goſpell, and Chriſt is come, the ſubſtance of all thoſe dark Types and ſhadowes. Secondly, they had the Judiciall Law, which was the civill or poſitive Law of their Common-wealth; ſo anſwerable to this, wee have our poſitive Lawes of this Kingdome. Thirdly, they had the eternall Morall Law of God, which commandeth ſimply without guile to worſhip God with pure faith and godly life. Secondly, it commandeth to imbrace man with unfained love, it is the true and eternall rule of all righteous walking both to God and men, and it is preſcribed to men of all ages and times who are willing to frame their lives to the will of God, for this is his eternall and unchangeable will, that he himſelfe ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:155189:15"/>be worſhipped of us all, and that we ſhould mutually love one another; So then although the judiciall or poſitive Lawes of the Jewes be taken away, yet the perpetuall duties of the Morall Law abide for ever.</p>
            <p>Hence I gather, that every Nation hath that liberty left them to make ſuch Lawes as they ſhall foreſee to be moſt profitable for them, but they muſt be framed after the perpetuall rule of charity, they muſt be grounded upon the ſame foundation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may differ in the form-from other Nations: Now the Law of God which we call morall, is nothing elſe but a teſtimony of the naturall Law that was written in the heart of man by creation, &amp; ſome reliques of it are ſtill remaining in man, this morall law muſt be the marke, and end, and rule of all Lawes; then whatſoever lawes ſhall be framed according to that rule, and directed to that mark, and limited to that end, there is no cauſe why we ſhould diſallow them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they differ from the Jewiſh Law, or one Kingdome from another in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of it: as for example; the law of God forbiddeth ſtealing, now the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialty of theft is ſet downe in the civill lawes of the Jewes, to <hi>reſtore five oxen for an oxe and foure ſheep for a ſheep,</hi> Exod. 22.1. Now other Nations puniſhed theft with recompence of double, the lawes that followed afterwards made diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between manifeſt theft and that which was not manifeſt, and ſome procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to baniſhment, ſome to whipping and ſome at laſt to the puniſhment of death: Again, for falſe witneſſing among the Jewes was puniſhed with recompence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall paine <hi>Deut,</hi> 19.18. In ſome places onely with great ſhame, in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with hanging, in otherſome with the croſſe; and for man-ſlaughter, all lawes univerſally do revenge with bloud, yet with divers kinds of death: &amp; for adultery, in ſome places were ordained great puniſhment, and in ſome leſſer, yet we ſee for all this diverſity, all tend to the ſame end, for they all agree togehter to puniſh thoſe offences which the eternall law of God conde ones, as man-ſlaughter, thefts, adulteries, falſe w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>eſſing, &amp;c. But in the manner of puniſhment they agree not, neither is it needfull that they ſhould, for in ſome Countries they muſt ſhew vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour with horrible examples againſt man ſlayers or elſe they will be immediately ruined with murders and robberies, and ſometimes puniſhments ought to be more ſevere then at other times, as in the time of was, all humanity would be caſt away unleſſe they then uſe unwonted fear of puniſhments; and ſome Countreys are more addicted to ſome certaine vice, which muſt be the more ſharply puniſhed to ſtop the ſpreading of it. Hence we muſt not conceive that the eternall law of God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated, and new Lawes made and put in the place thereof, and prefe red above it, for they are not preferd above it ſimply, but in reſpect of the times, places and Nations, neither was the Morall Law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but to <hi>Adam</hi> before he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and manifeſted in writing to <hi>Moſes,</hi> not for the Jewes only, but for all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to be the ground of all their poſitive Lawes.</p>

               <p>FIrſt, being the 14th. in number, they object againſt our lawes and Magiſtrates, ſaying, that they are of no uſe for Chriſtians, for we cannot lawfully crave
<pb facs="tcp:155189:15"/>their aid in any ſuite at law, becauſe they are forbidden to revenge, or to have any controverſie. I anſwer, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that he is the Miniſter of God for good, and he is ſo ordained of God, and for that very purpoſe, attending continually upon this very thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.16. To defend us from the malice &amp; injuries of miſchievous men, therefore we ought to pray for thoſe in authority, that we may live a quiet &amp; a peaceable life, but unleſſe it be lawfull to uſe ſuch helpe and benefit, they were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us in vaine from the Lord, and ſaith <hi>Demetrius,</hi> if any man have a matter againſt another, the law is open, and there are Deputies, let them implead one another; and if you enquire any thing concerning other matters, it ſhalbe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in a lawfull aſſembly, <hi>Acts</hi> 19, 28, 39. And ſaith Chriſt: <hi>Agree with thine adverſary quickly while thou art in the way with him, leſt thine adverſary deliver thee to the Iudge, and the Iudge deliver thee to the Sergeant, and thou be caſt into priſon; verily I ſay unto thee, thou ſhalt not come out till thou haſt paid the uttermoſt farthing,</hi> Math. 5.25, 26. Upon theſe words ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Chriſt here alloweth of the Magiſtrate and ſear of judgement, 1. Of his proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the guilty, in delivering him to the officer, 2. Of the office of the Sergeant, 3. Of caſting guilty perſons into priſon, 4. Of ſuing at the Law, when right cannot be had by other lawfull meanes, but law muſt not be the firſt courſe that we take in ſeeking our right, we muſt rather ſuffer ſome wrong, and ſeek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="15">15. But they object, thoſe which ſeek helpe at the Magiſtrates hands for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others, do prevent that help which they ſhould have from God their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly defender, I anſwer, not ſo, for the Magiſtrate is the miniſter of God ordained for this very end, to deliver his afflicted people from the cruell hands of wicked and malicious men; but they will reply in thoſe words of Chriſt, ſaying, reſiſt not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, but whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on the right cheek, turne to him the other alſo, and if any man ſue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak alſo. I anſwer, here Chriſt would have them ſuffer double injury, rather then go to law, eſpecially when they ſeeke to revenge themſelves by law; all this I grant, and more alſo, for their whole life ſhould be a continuall bearing the croſſe, when one is gone to fit themſelves for another; They muſt doe good to them that doe them wrong, and wiſh well to thoſe that curſe them, and, which is the only victory, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome evill with good, being thus minded, they wil not ſeeke eye for eye, and tooth for tooth, as the Phariſees taught their Diſciples to deſire revenge; yet all this hinders not, but that a Chriſtian may uſe the lawfull help of the Magiſtrate to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their goods, or through their love and zeale to the Common-wealth, they may ſue a malefactor at the Bar for his life.</p>
               <p n="16">16. They will object that contendings in law are altogether forbidden &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by <hi>Paul,</hi> where he ſaith: <hi>Brother goeth to law with brother, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:155189:16"/>unbeleevers;</hi> Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, becauſe ye goe to law one with another: <hi>Why do you not rather ſuffer wrong, why do you not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer your ſelves to be defrauded?</hi> 1 Cor. 6.6, 7. I anſwer, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf went to law with his adverſaries, for ſaid <hi>Paul,</hi> I ſtand at Ceſars judgment ſcate, where Tought to be judged, <hi>Acts</hi> 25.10. And he anſwered for himſelfe, ſaying; <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the law of the Iewes, nor againſt the Temple, nor againſt</hi> Ceſar <hi>have I offended any thing at all; for if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuſe not to dye,</hi> verſ. 8.11. Then how can any wiſe man think that <hi>Paul</hi> went to condemn that which he himſelfe did? if this were true, we might retort thoſe words back upon himſelfe, ſaying; <hi>Thou that judgeſt another, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n ſt thy ſelfe, for thou that judgeſt, doſt the ſame things,</hi> Rom. 2.1. And as the Jewes ſaid to Chriſt, Phyſitian, <hi>heale thy ſelfe, ſlandering his holy and blameleſſe life that never did amiſſe, neither was guile found in his mouth; and ſo</hi> Paul <hi>living in all good conſcience both towards God and towards man,</hi> Acts 24.16. Yet theſe men would here faſten a reproach upon him, to teach contrary to his practice; wel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true meaning of <hi>Paul</hi> was this, that becauſe the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were very much given to contentions and ſtrivings at law, and that before heathen Judges, which became a great ſcandall to their profeſſion, in not ſhewing Chriſtian meekeneſſe one to another which they ought to do, yea they were ſo far from covering wrongs, that they greedily coveted one anothers goods, and ſo provoked one another to wrath: ſo that here <hi>Paul</hi> blames their abuſe of this ordinance, when every trifling matter was enough to make them run to the Court of Law, and the leaſt occaſion that could be, was enough to kindle ſtrife and contention, and to reveoge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves one of another; This <hi>Paul</hi> blames, but not the lawfull uſe of this ordinance appointed of God to preſerve peace and unity, ſo that you ſee in all this that civill government is both lawfull and very neceſſary; then this may diſcover the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe of that man of ſin the Antichriſt, who ſits in the Temple of God, and exalts himſelfe above all that is called God, and ſhewing himſelfe that he is God, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. Thus againſt God himſelfe, and againſt his Deputies who beare his name, he hath for many hundred yeares uſurped a ſupremacy over civill government, being the higheſt rebellion that ever was in the world; for ſaith the Apoſtle: <hi>Every ſoule muſt be ſubject to the higher powers,</hi> Rom. 13.1. But let us heare what he hath to ſay for himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he objecteth againſt this place, ſaying, that it is to be underſtood of thoſe that to be ſubject, but the Popes themſelves are exempted; To this I anſwer, if the Pope have a ſoule, he muſt be ſubject to civill government; this is not to bring the ſoule it ſelfe into ſubjection to civill government, but this is ſpoken of all men living, who have ſouls, thoſe men, their words and actions, body and goods, are to be ſubject to civill government; but in this reply of his exempting himſelfe from all ſubjection to civill power, he plainly ſhews himſelfe to be that Antichriſt who exalts himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all that is called God, meaning all civill powers and Magiſtrates who are Gods Deputies, and who alone beare him name, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 82.1.2. <hi>When they
<pb facs="tcp:155189:16"/>are upon the Throne of judgement, God judgeth among the Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, but they object that <hi>Vzziah</hi> the King burnt Incenſe upon the altar of Incenſe: <hi>Then</hi> Azariah <hi>the Prieſt went in after him, and fourſcore Prieſts of the Lord that were valiant men, and they withſtood</hi> Uzziah <hi>the King, and</hi> Azariah <hi>the chiefe Prieſt, and all the Prieſts looked upon him, and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thruſt him out from thence,</hi> 2 Chron. 26.17, 18.20. Here ſay they, the Prieſt depoſed the King, and thruſt him out of the Temple: I anſwer, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zariah</hi> reſiſted the King not by force or violence, but by word only and admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby they cauſed him to depart out of the Temple; for it is ſaid, that hee himſelfe haſted to go out, verſ. 20. Neither was he depoſed from his government, but being by God ſtricken ſodainly with a leproſie, he was by the law ſhut out from the company and ſociety of men, and ſo diſabled to govern, although the right of it ſtill belonged unto him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they object that example of <hi>Iehojada</hi> the high Prieſt who depoſed Qu: <hi>Athaliah</hi> from her Kingdome, and ſet up young <hi>Ioaſh</hi> to be King, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. Hence they conclude that the Pope hath authority to depoſe Kings and Emperours: I anſwer, <hi>Iehojadah</hi> the high Prieſt was next to the King in blood, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.11. And was one of the States of the Land, who depoſed her not alone by himſelfe, but by the common conſent of all the States and Peeres of the Land, ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 23.1, 2. He indeed is chiefly named, becauſe he was the chiefe of them in blood; neither did he ſet up <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> but helped to maintain his right which was uſurped by <hi>Athaliah:</hi> in a word, he protected the right heire, but could not himſelfe depoſe nor make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Kingdome unto him; hence I conclude, that to exempt the Clergie from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the authority of the Civill Magiſtrate is rebellion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they object that Kings and Princes of their bounty have granted theſe priviledges unto them. I anſwer, the law of nature acknowledgeth a civill ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the law of God ſtraightly commands it, ſaying: <hi>Let every ſoule be ſubject to the higher powers,</hi> Rom. 13. And put them in mind to be ſubject to principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and powers, to obey Magiſtrates, and to be ready to every good worke, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.1. Then I conclude hence, that no law of any man may offer violence, or dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from either of theſe.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, they object from <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.10. where the Lord ſaith, <hi>I have ſet thee over Nations and Kingdomes, to plant and to pluck up:</hi> Hence they gather, that the Prophets and their Succeſſors are not to be ſubject unto civill Government: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the Prophet is ſet over Nations and Kingdomes, but not to governe by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill ſword, but by the ſword of the ſpirit in his mouth, and he is to plant and pluck up Kingdomes no otherwiſe then by declaring that God would plant, or pluck them up.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, they object from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.10. <hi>That Kings ſhall come and ſerve the Church under the new Teſtament,</hi> and therefore the Church is not to be ſubject to Princes, but they unto the Church: I anſwer, in the Church are two things, firſt, the perſons of men, ſecondly, the things of God: Now it is true that Kings are
<pb facs="tcp:155189:17"/>ſubject to the things of God in the Church, as the word and Sacraments, to theſe Ordinances of God no calling is exempted, ſaith <hi>Paul, our ſelves are ſervants for Ieſus ſake;</hi> But to the firſt of theſe, which is, the perſons of believers, to theſe, Kings and Magiſtrates are not ſubject; but to this very queſtion, when ſome ſervants were converted, when they lived under Infidell Maſters, they thought themſelves by this ſpiritual calling to be freed from ſerving their Maſters any longer, but (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>Let every man abide in the ſame calling wherin he was called; art thou called to the ſtate of grace being a ſervant? care not for it, yet if thou couldeſt be freed from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Infidel, uſe it rather; but if thou canſt not, here is thy comfort, he that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, being a ſervant, is the Lords free-man, therfore brethren let every man wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is called, therein abide with God,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.20.21.22.24. So a ſubject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called, is not freed of his obedience to Civill Government, although he were effectually called under Infidel Governours: it is in this caſe, as it is with outward riches, the people of God onely have a true right to them all by Chriſt, ſo that all the riches in the world is theirs, <hi>all is yours, and ye are Chriſts,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.21. And what others have, they are but uſurpers, yet beleevers muſt not preſently goe and take theſe outward things from any man, although he be never ſo wicked; So it is with places of Maſters or Magiſtrates, although never ſo wicked, yet while they are in it, we ought to yeild obedience to them, for (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>Cervants be ſubject to your Maſters with all feare,</hi> (now marke) <hi>not onely to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.18.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, they object that Kings and Magiſtrates are as ſheep, and Miniſters are as Paſtors and Shepherds, therefore ſay they, Kings are under Miniſters, as the flock is under the Shepherd: I anſwer, in the Prophets or Paſtors conſider two things; firſt their perſons, ſecondly their Miniſtery; now in regard of their perſons all of them are ſubject to their Princes, and that for conſcience ſake, but in regard of their Miniſtry, Princes and Magiſtrates are to be ſubject, both when the Word is taught &amp; the Sacraments be adminiſtred, all muſt ſubmit themſelves unto it; even as a mean man being a Serjeant, may arreſt a Baron, Earle or Duke, neither may they reſiſt him, becauſe he commeth with the Princes authority to which he muſt yeild himſelfe, though not unto the perſon of the Serjeant; So muſt Magiſtrates ſubmit unto Miniſters, comming not in their owne name, but in the name of God and Chriſt; now this muſt be marked, that Magiſtrates are not ſimply ſubject to the Miniſtry, but ſo far as they teach the word truly, and rightly adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the which if they doe not, they have power to reforme or depoſe ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters as ſhall faile in their adminiſtration, and in this regard Magiſtrates are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Shepherds, <hi>The Lord ſaith,</hi> Cyrus <hi>is my ſhepherd,</hi> Iſa. 44.28. Though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he be a ſheep, ſo far as he is truly taught by the Miniſter, <hi>For they may ſay to the King and to the Queeno, humble your ſelves,</hi> Jer. 14.18. <hi>And</hi> Herod <hi>feared</hi> John, <hi>and did many things, and heard him gladly,</hi> Mark 6.20. Thus we ſee that all men are to ſubmit themſelves to the Magiſtracy or Civil Government, and to the poſitive Lawes of the Land.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:155189:17"/>
               <p> Now the Romiſh Clergy are not enemies to Civil Government, as it is govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but as it is in the hand of Civil Magiſtrates, ſo that their drift is not to put it downe, but to remove it from the Magiſtrates to themſelves, that they might make all Magiſtrates their vaſſals. Secondly, prophane people doe allow of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their judgment, but they would have ſome liberty to intrench upon it in their practiſe. Thirdly, Anunomians and Ean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lifts are enemies to the eternall law of God, which is the ground and foundation of the civil law, which, while they take a way the foundation, of neceſſity the whole building muſt needs fall; So they, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they wil not openly ſay that they are enemies to civil government, yet by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, they are enemies to it, &amp; in their way ſeek to overthrow it, 4, the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant people or the Browniſts, who will have Kings and Rulers and Magiſtrates to have no hand in matters of religion, but all to be ſervants to the perſons of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſo they deny <hi>Ceſar</hi> his due, which is to have power over the outward man both of words and actions, body and goods, although he hath no power over the things of God, which are, their ſoules and conſciences, faith and all the graces of Gods ſpirit that are wrought in the heart, <hi>yet we muſt obey them for conſcience ſake,</hi> Rom. 13.5. Not as to bring theſe things of God under their command, but obeying becauſe God commands it, <hi>even from the heart as to the Lord,</hi> Col. 3.23.

<pb facs="tcp:155189:18"/>from whence the name of Proteſtants did firſt ariſe, for when <hi>Luther</hi> did firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that ſtrumpet of <hi>Rome,</hi> he cauſed them all that were with him to enter into a Proteſtation againſt all Popery and popiſh Innovations, and thoſe that took that proteſtation were ever afterwards called Proteſtants, &amp; we in this Kingdome have of late taken the very ſame Proteſtation againſt all Popery and popiſh Innovations, therefore I doubt not but we have many amongſt us, who will hazard lives and States and all they have to maintain that proteſtation, and ſo by the good bleſſing of the Lord will prove themſelves good and faithfull Proteſtants: But for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, although I call it <hi>Calvin's</hi> Inſtitutions, yet not as if he had made it of his owne head, but as a faithfull ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, he hath faithfully declared all the Counſell of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.27. to all his fellow-brethren, that all may ſee what a Church Chriſt hath inſtituted in his word.</p>
               <p>Alſo this doth well agree with our late ſolemne Nationall Covenant, in which we have bound our ſelves, with our hands lifted up to the moſt high God, ſwearing thus; That we ſhall ſincerely, really and conſtantly through the grace of God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in our ſeverall places and callings, the preſervation of the reformed Church of Scotland, in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Government againſt our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemies. Now I hope all thoſe that have thus engaged themſelves, are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that their doctrine, worſhip, diſcipline and government are agreeable to Gods Word, elſe why have we bound our ſelves to preſerve it there, and to acknowledge the enemies of it to be our common enemies, yet I deny not, but as it is there, it may have ſome failings which may admit of reformation: The Lord open our reformers eyes that they may connive at nothing that may prejudice the honour of Chriſt, or the good of his Church, but whatſoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.23.</p>
               <p>Againe, wee have ſworne to endeavour the reformation of religion in England, Scotland, and Ireland, in doctrine, worſhip, diſcipline and government according to Gods Word, and the beſt reformed Churches, and for this I hope we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that the Presbyteriall is the beſt reformation, elſe why do we bind our ſelves to preſerve it in Scotland? we are or ſhould be reſolved be reſolved before we vow, and not after vowes to make enquiry, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.25.</p>
               <p>Againe, we ſwear, that we will endeavour to bring the Churches of God in the three Kingdomes to the neareſt conjunction and uniformity in religion, confeſſion of faith, ſorme of Church-government, directory for worſhip, and Chattechiſing, but if Scotlands government and diſcipline muſt not be altered, the caſe is cleare, that we have bound our ſelves to uniformity with them in the fore-mentioned things: <hi>Let therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded, and if in any thing ye be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded, God ſhall reveale even this unto you,</hi> Phil. 3.15. Thus you ſee the harmony between our proteſtation and <hi>Luthers</hi> proteſtation, as alſo betweene our Covenant and <hi>Calvins</hi> Inſtitution, thus far bleſſed be the Lord for our bleſſed uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore my motion I hope will not ſeem ſtrange, when I ſhall deſire faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to our late Proteſtation, and to our ſolemne Covenant, not as though I did
<pb facs="tcp:155189:18"/>queſtion the faithfulneſſe of our reformers, for bleſſed be God they have already done more, then ſome yeares agone we thought we ſhould ever have lived to ſee, or as though I queſtioned the faithfulnes of any that have taken that proteſtation or covenant only I wiſh &amp; pray for their perſeverance; <hi>That as their hands have laid the head ſtone thereof, their hands alſo may finiſh it, and when they bring forth the foundation of this houſe with ſhouting we ſhall cry, grace grace unto it.</hi> Zech. 4.7.9.</p>
               <p>But I muſt expect ſome foul-mouth'd Prelate to ſtand up as in Doctor <hi>Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick's</hi> caſe ſaying, that baſe fellow <hi>Calvin,</hi> for ſo that old <hi>Francis White</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of <hi>Ely</hi> called that ever to he honoured Divine, ſaying that he aroſe in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure come of the world, and violated and overthrew all order and authority in the Church, and would alſo have demoliſhed the authority of the Magiſtrates; and then the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe are they that blame <hi>Calvin</hi> for his factious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and call him baſe fellow, and that he ſhould ſeeke to overthrow all order and authority n the Church, and to demoliſh the authority of the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>Again, the Prelate <hi>Whitgift</hi> and <hi>Saravia</hi> daſh one againſt another about ruling Elders and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſbiteries, <hi>Whitgift</hi> doth acknowledge they ought to be under a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but not under a Chriſtian Magiſtracy, the other will allow them to be under a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, but not under an Infidell. Firſt, whereas <hi>Whitgift</hi> ſaith ther were in the Primitive Church Seniors, but it was before there was any Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Prince or Magiſtrate. Secondly, and that God hath given the chiefe authority of government in the Church to to the Chriſtian Magiſtrate. Thirdly, that if there were a Seniory eſtabliſhed, there could remaine no authority Eccleſiaſticall to the Civil Magiſtrate: I anſwer, if the office of Seniors under a Tyrant had medled with any part of the office of the Magiſtrate, then ſo much as they exerciſed of the office of the Magiſtrate, ſo much ſhould have ceaſed; but the Elde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s are to aſſiſt the Paſtor in matters Eccleſiaſticall onely, and not in Civil, therfore it ought to be in times of peace, aſwel as in times of perſecution, and if a Tyrant-Magiſtrate could ſuffer them, it is evident that they did not offend againſt his office.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there were Seniors among the Jewes under godly Kings and in times of peace, then why may it not be ſo among Chriſtians?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Eccleſiaſtical power is diſtinct from the Civil both in the ſubject, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and end, ſo that the one doth not h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nder the other; the Magiſtrates power is to puniſh the outward man with outward puniſhment, which the Presb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:155189:19"/>civilly looſe, whom the Presbitery ſpiritually bindeth; Laſtly, the Magiſtrate ſeeks not the repentance and ſalvation of the delinquent by his puniſhment, as the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitery doth, be only ſeeks to maintain the authority of his Lawes, and the qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nes and preſervation of the Common-wealth, ſo that a delinquent by repentance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape the Civil Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Magiſtrate cannot determine queſtions of faith, nor know what order and decency in circumſtances is fitteſt for each Congregation, neither can he excommunicate offenders, for when the Prelates exerciſed Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and civil alſo, they did wrong both to the Prince; and alſo to the Presbitery.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, when Presbiters are eſtabliſhed in their full power, there remaines much power to the Prince even in things Eccleſiaſticall, as to take diligent heed to the whole State of the Church within his Dominions, to indict Synods, and civilly to proceed in the ſame, to ratifie the conſtitutions thereof, to adde unto them the ſtrength of a civil power, to puniſh heretiques, and all that diſobey the aſſemblies of the Church, to ſee that no matter Eccleſiaſticall be carried factiouſly or raſhly, but that ſuch things be determined in free aſſemblies, to provide for Schollars, Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Churches, that all corrupt wayes of entring into the miniſtery, by Simony, bribing or otherwiſe, be repreſted; and laſtly, to compel all men to doe their duty according to the word of God, and the lawes of the Church. So then the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is to leave untouched that power which belongs to the Eccleſiaſticall rulers, as the miniſters of the Goſpel, ruling Elders and Deacons for Eccleſiaſtical, doe not hinder the Civil in their adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, is it ſo, that Prelates exclaime againſt Presbiteriall government? let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort their exclamation back upon their own-heads, as <hi>Eliſhah</hi> did in another caſe, ſaying, it is thou and thy Fathers houſe that troubled Iſrael; So I ſay, it is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, not the Presbitery that is prejudiciall to the power of Princes, and hath often encroached upon the ſame, as for example, the Biſhops aſſembled in the 8. councell of Conſtantinople, ordained that Biſhops ſhould not light from their horſes when they chanced to meet Princes, nor baſely bow before them; and if any Prince ſhould cauſe a Biſhop to diſparage himſelfe by doing otherwiſe, he ſhould be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated for two years, Canon 14. And in the ſame councel, Canon 17. they alſo diſcharged Princes from being preſent in any Synod, except the Occumenick: ſo much for anſwer to <hi>Whitgift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for <hi>Saraviah</hi> who alloweth ſuch Elders as the Jewiſh Church had to be joyned now with Paſtors under a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, but not under an Infidell Magiſtrate, but this man takes the Jewiſh Elders to be their Magiſtrates, and ſo he affirmes that none but Chriſtian Magiſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gift,</hi> for you ſee a plaine diſtinction between the power Eccleſiaſticall and the Civill, both in the ſubject, object, and end, as I ſhewed before, and that the one is not to touch or to meddle with the office of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb facs="tcp:155189:19"/>Now if the Chriſtian Magiſtrate by vertue of his civill power ſhould ſit in Spirituall Courts, this would make a mixture and confuſion of civill and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Functions; and again, he contradicteth himſelfe, ſaying, that he admitteth grave and godly men in the Judicatories of the Church, although they be not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, but private men. Again, there have been Chriſtian Churches under Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell Princes; but here I leave theſe two men as <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and both againſt <hi>Iudah;</hi> ſo <hi>Whitgift</hi> againſt <hi>Saravia,</hi> and <hi>Saravia</hi> againſt <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and both againſt the truth.</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe the Cavaliers at <hi>Oxford</hi> ſhould ſtep forth and ſay that the Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall government is worſe then the high Commiſſion or the Spaniſh Inquiſition; ſee Diurnal, <hi>Feb.</hi> 22. 1643. I anſwer, it is but the teſtimony of prophane Papiſts, and blaſpheming perjured Traytors both to Church and State, and therefore I leave them as not worthy to be anſwered.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe they ſhould ſeek to comply with our independant people, and tell them that the King will grant them a free toleration if they wiladhere to him to oppoſe Presbiteriall government. I anſwer, it hath caſt an ill ſavour upon indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant government, and makes it to reliſh baſely with Gods people.</p>
               <p>But what if the independant people themſelves ſhall take upon them to examine the Presbiteriall government, and preſent their examination to the King and both Houſes of Parliament, and tell them boldly, that all learned men have granted that the Churches conſtituted by the Apoſtles were all independant bodies but the man cannot produce any of theſe learned men, and therefore the caſe is doubtfull, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it were a hard caſe if neither Scotland, France, Holland; and many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the Presbiteriall government is, or hath been, could not yeeld a learned man, this man I ſuppoſe to be either a Cobler or a Button-maker, or ſome ſuch prime Scholler, and yet be takes upon him to examine the learning of all the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches; but wil you be pleaſed to ſee his learned expoſition of ſome texes of Scripture, ſuch as theſe? <hi>The Kingdome of God is at hand,</hi> that is ſaith he, <hi>a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation is at hand,</hi> Math. 3.2. <hi>And to be fellow Citizens with the Saints and of the houſhold of God,</hi> this ſaith he, is meant of a paiticular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.19. <hi>And for the Queen to ſtand on the right hand of Chriſt in gold of Ophir,</hi> this ſaith he alſo is a particular congregation, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 45.9. Thus you ſee how this mans learning exceeds all thereformed Churches, who expound theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be meant of the univerſall or inviſible Church.</p>
               <p>But further he ſaith in that examination, that the Pope is Antichriſt becauſe hee will have men to appeale from other Churches to him, and to ſtand to his ſentence and decree; but ſaith he, doe not Presbiter: all Aſſemblies and Synods take upon them the ſame authority?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, no, they differ thus: Firſt, the Pope is one and receiveth appellations Monarchically, but Synods conſiſt of many, and receive appellations ariſtecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly. 2. The Pope receiveth appellations from other Nations beyond Sea, but Presbiteries and Synods do not ſo. 3. The Pope will have his ſentence received as
<pb facs="tcp:155189:20"/>infallible, but Presbiteties and Synods acknowledge themſelves ſubject to errour. 4. The Pope acknowledgeth neither Elders nor elderſhips of Congregations, but Presbiteries and Synods doe 5. The Pope acknowledgeth no power Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call on earth, but what is ſubject to him, and derived from him, but Presbiteries &amp; Synods doe. 6. The Pope receiveth appellations in other cauſes beſides Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, but Presbiteries and Synods do not ſo. 7 The Pope hath neither commiſſion himſelfe from Churches, nor will admit the Commiſſioners of Churches to ſit in judgement with him, but Synods are made up of Commiſſioners of Churches. 8. The Pope maketh his power boundleſſe, &amp; exalteth himſelfe above the very Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but Synods when they receive appellations, are tyed to certaine rules of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and judging, eſpecially by the Scriptures; thus wiſe men may ſee the diſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them to be as great as between light and darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>But now give me leave, being thus ſet upon by the independant men, to lay open ſome of their errours, to ſee how they will ſtand in a well ordered Church.</p>
               <p>Firſt, independant Churches hold themſelves to be all Rulers, and none to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: which is againſt all ſence, reaſon, and Scripture alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7.27.1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. But they are ſomething aſhamed that they have none to rule, therefore they would make their ruling Elders themſelves be their ſervants; and yet to hold ſtill the name of rulers, which is as bad an errour as the former, for although ruling Elders muſt not be as Lords to the Church, neither muſt the Church be as Lords over them, and while they claime this authority for their Church, they do but ſeeke to remove the Prelates Lordſhip to their independant Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They do not give thoſe to the Lord from their child-hood that are to be their Miniſters, that they may be trained up in the ſchooles of the Prophets, which is the ordinary way for to attain to the knowledge of the tongues; <hi>Now that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary is ceaſed which the Apoſtles had.</hi> Lu. 24.49. Acts 2.4. But they not taking this courſe, are conſtrained either to take ſome broken Tradeſman for their Paſtor to be employed in Gods work, whom the world hath caſt off, or elſe they muſt take one that is employed in a calling already; But for the firſt, will God accept of the worlds leavings? and for the ſecond, what warrant have they to take a man to this great calling, <hi>who is already entangled with the affairs of this life?</hi> ſee 2 Tim. 2.4. The Miniſtry alone is a burden more befitting an Angell then a fraile man, ſaith <hi>Paul, who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> 2 Cor. 2.16. The Apoſtles gave themſelves wholly and continually to prayer and to the Miniſtery of the Word, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.4 And yet they complain of their weakneſſe, as unable to undertake ſuch a heavy burden, who were ſo exceedingly furniſhed with giſts, and gave themſelves wholly to it, how then ſhall our independent Paſtors diſcharge it faithfully, who are employed otherwiſe: <hi>If the world encreaſe, the work of God muſt needs decreaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, when their Paſtors gifts are to be proved, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10. They will appoint none but mechanick men to do it, unleſſe ſome Miniſters come in by chance unexpected, not as any duty they are boun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to do, for they are all inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant, &amp; who hath to do with them? but how ſhall Mechanicks judge of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
<pb facs="tcp:155189:20"/>and controverſies of faith or how ſhall they determine the ſame? they cannot find out and diſcover ſub i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e Hereticks, then how ſhall they excommunicate them?</p>
               <p>But I ſuppoſe in this they goe contrary to their own judgment in other things, when they will have all other things tryed and proved by men of that calling which have the moſt knowledge and skill in ſuch a thing, that they may not be deceived, and will they have leſſe care of their ſoules then they have of worldly things, it is but a bad ſigne of grace in ſuch a heart.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, mechanick fellowes muſt intrench upon the miniſtery after they have proved them to ordain them, but although the Cities of Creet might elect them El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yet ſaith <hi>Paul, I left thee in Creet to ordaine Elders in every Citie as I had appointed thee.</hi> Titus 1.5. <hi>And</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>retu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But I find no mechanicks about the point of ordination.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, theſe mechanick fellows which are unskilfull in the Paſtors office, yet they muſt teach them their duty that never were Paſtors themſelves, &amp; theſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers may very well be ignorant of many poynts of faith, being ſometimes long without a Paſtor, then much more they may be ignorant of his office, yet they muſt pray for they know not what, and the greater muſt be bleſſed of the leſter, neither muſt theſe ſick people have any helpe from others, till they can helpe themſelves; but I thinke they would not do ſo by their bodies which would ſoon periſh if none muſt help them in time of ſickneſſe: but God hath better provided for his Church then ſo.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, they hold that not only the power of the keyes, but the execution of this power alſo belongs, and muſt be done by all the congregation, but the puniſhment of excommunication, ſaith the Apoſtle, was inflicted of many, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. But this were improper to ſay it was inflicted by many, if it was by all, yet I grant it muſt be done by the conſent of all, or of the greateſt part, and it may be ſaid to be done by all, as the repreſentative body of all, as what the Parliament doth, it may be ſaid the whole Kindom doth: but as the Kingdome refers their buſineſſe to the Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>liament, ſo doe the particular Churches to the Presbitery: but they ſay every caſe ought to be heard and determined where the fault was committed: By this argument we muſt remove our Parliament and all other Courts to the place where any offence is
<pb facs="tcp:155189:21"/>committed to try them there. But this their folly needs no confutation, and ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> concerning Church cenſures, I heare <hi>that there is fornication committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you,</hi> (now marke) <hi>For I verily as abſent in body, but preſent in ſpirit, have judged and determined already concerning him that hath ſo done, and that was to deliver ſuch a one to Sathan for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the day of the Lord Ieſus:</hi> Yet it was not fully done without the conſent of the whole Congregation, although judged and determined in their abſence; <hi>Yet it was executed when they were gathered together,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.3, 4, 5. So the Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery ought to judge and determine of things, but they are not to be accompliſhed privately, but openly with the conſent of the whole congregation.</p>
               <p>But they ſay, <hi>if thy Brother treſpaſſe againſt thee, tell him his fault betweene him and thee alone, and if he will not heare thee, take with thee one or two more; but if he neglect to heare them, tell the Church,</hi> Mat. 18.15.16.17. This Church (ſay they) is a particular Congregation. but I deny it, and will prove it to be a collective part repreſenting the Church, to whom binding and looſing was referred, for (ſaith the Lord) <hi>if two of you ſhall agree on earth touching any thing as binding and looſing it ſhal be done for them of my Father in heaven,</hi> verſ. 18.19.

If there be at this time any Magiſtrates for the behoofe of the people, ſuch as in old time were the Ephori that were ſet againſt the Kings in Lacedemonia, or the Tribunes of the people againſt the Roman Conſuls, or the Demarchi againſt the Senate of Athens: or as it is with us, the three Eſtates in Parliament, holding the principall Aſſemblies, ſaith he, I am ſo far from forbidding theſe to withſtand the outrageing licentiouſneſſe of Kings, that I affirme, that if they winke at Kings wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rageing over, and treading down the poore Communalty, that their diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling is not without wicked breach of faith, becauſe they deceitfully betray the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the people, whereof they know themſelves to be appointed protectors by the ordinance of God. And ſaith he in the 8. Section, no kinde of governement is more bleſſed then this, where liberty is framed with ſuch a moderation, as it ought to be, and is orderly eſtabliſhed for continuance, and ſo I count them moſt bleſſed, that may enjoy this eſtate, and if they ſtoutly and conſtantly trav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then would any bring in Monarchical government? let me tell them that it is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſeene that Kings ſo temper themſelves, that they will never ſwerve from that which is juſt and right. Again, they are not alwaies furniſhed with ſo great a ſharpneſſe of judgment and wiſedome, that every one ſeeth ſo much as is ſufficient for every thing; therefore the wants that are in ſingle perſons, are cauſe ſufficient to prove it to be more ſafe and tolerable, that many ſhould have the government, that they may mutually help one another, and one teach and admoniſh another, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:155189:24"/>if any advance himſelfe higher then it is meet, there may be others to reſtraine his wilfulneſſe; ſo then in caſe a King be a child, and not able to order the affaires of his Kingdome, or in caſe he want naturall abilities, or in caſe he be led away by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Counſellors, then the Magiſtrates ought to make ſupply, that neither the King nor his Subjects may ſuffer wrong: This way of government gives more honour to Kings then any other, becauſe this procures the love and happineſſe of the Subjects, when as Monarchicall brings feare, miſery, and ſlavery upon them; ſo then this kind of government is the beſt, wherein King and people do rejoyce in each others hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</p>
               <p>Again, it may be demanded, if the chiefe Magiſtrate and the reſt be at variance, &amp; the contention encreaſe ſo through ill-affected perſons, that it produce civill wars amonſt us, now what are the inferiour people to do in this caſe, and who are they to ſide withall?

Therefore we muſt not ſo obey the King, as to make us diſobey the King of Kings, unto whoſe Scepter all Kings muſt yield obedience: therefore when <hi>Daniel</hi> diſobeyed the Kings proclamation, he anſwered with a cleare conſcience ſaying, <hi>againſt thee ô King I have done no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So then we muſt put difference between our obedience to God, and our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to man; when God commands, we are not to reaſon with fleſh and blood, nor
<pb facs="tcp:155189:24"/>call into queſtion the lawfulneſſe of it; <hi>God is greater then man, and he gives no account of any of his matters,</hi> Job 33.12, 13. It is our duty to put in practiſe with all ſpeed what God commands us: but when man commands, we muſt bring it to the tryall, and ſee how it agrees with that perfect rule of Gods command, and if it agree not with Gods command, we muſt not obey it, as for example: God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that we ſhall not murder? now if the King do command us to murder, this contradicts Gods command, and therefore muſt not be obeyed. <hi>King</hi> Saul <hi>ſaid to the footmen that ſtood about him, turne ye and ſlay the Prieſts of the Lord; but the ſervants of the King would not put forth their hands to fall on the Prieſts of the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.17. <hi>And King</hi> Pharoah <hi>ſent unto the Mid-wives ſay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

After this they were taken and brought before the Councell againe, who ſaid unto them, did not we ſtraightly charge you not to teach in this name? and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold you have filled Jeruſalem with your Doctrine, and intend to bring this mans blood upon us, and they anſwered: <hi>We ought to obey God rather then men,</hi> Acts 5.17, 18, 19. <hi>The feare of men brings a ſnare,</hi> Prov. 29.25. Thus wee may ſee, that although Magiſtrates muſt be obeyed, yet it muſt be onely when they keepe within their bounds, and not elſe.</p>
               <p>But ſome of our Court Prieſts will object and ſay, not through any love to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
<pb facs="tcp:155189:25"/>but only to make diviſions amongſt us, that every ſoule muſt be ſubject to the higher powers, for there is no power but of God, the powers that be, are ordained of God, whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the powers, reſiſteth the ordinance of God, &amp; they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2. But here by the way we may ſee how they poſt this Text off from themſelves, and then they thunder it againſt others; but when it is retorted back to themſelves, then they make exceptions, ſaying, all muſt obey but them, but to leave them in their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian pride; I anſwer, and grant, that the place of Magiſtracy is the ordinance of God, and thoſe Kings that keep within their bounds, are cloathed with Gods au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: for ſaith he, <hi>by me Kings reigne and Princes decree juſtice: by me Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces rule, and Nobles, yea all the Iudges of the earth,</hi> Prov. 8.15, 16. The God of Iſrael ſaid unto me: <hi>The rocke of Iſrael ſpake unto mee, he that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the feare of God,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.3. But are Princes alwayes ſuch: <hi>The heads of</hi> Jacob <hi>and Princes of Iſrael hate the good and love the evill, they eate the fleſh of Gods people, and flay their skin from off them, and breake their bones, and chop them in peices as for the pot, and as fleſh within the Caldron,</hi> Micah 3.1.2, 3. <hi>The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the Princes thereof, becauſe they beate in peices his people, and grinde the faces of the poore,</hi> Iſa 3.14, 15. <hi>Yea God renounceth ſuch Princes, ſaying, ye have ſet up Kings, but not by me; they have made them Princes, and I knew it not,</hi> Hoſea. 8.4. Not as though God were ignorant of what he did, but the meaning is, God did not approve of them, although their office be his ordinance.</p>
               <p>But they wil object, that where the word of a K. is, there is power, &amp; who may ſay to him, what doſt thou? <hi>Who ſo keepeth the Kings commandement, ſhall feel no evill thing,</hi> Eccl. 8.4, 5. I anſwer, the Kings power is over the outward man, his words and actions, body and goods; but it reacheh not to the ſoule and conſcience, nor the grace of Gods ſpirit in us, and though it be ſaid, <hi>be ſubject for conſcience ſake,</hi> Rom. 13.5.

I counſell thee to keep the Kings command, and that in regard of the oath of God, not that they have dominion over our faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. Or that our inward gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were under the Kings command, but we being ſenſible of Gods command, we obey them, becauſe he commands it, ſaying, <hi>let every ſoule be ſubject to the higher powers:</hi> Put them in mind to be ſubject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1.</p>
               <p>Our inward graces are more worthy then any humane dignity, therefore not to be brought in ſubjection to any, we muſt do good to others with our inward gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by vertue of Gods command, but they muſt not be brought under the power of any, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. But from the other words, who may ſay to him, what doſt thou? from theſe words, ſome Sycophants would perſwade Kings that their power is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited ſo that they may do what they liſt with any mans perſon and goods, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to the publike good of the whole Kingdome, if they doe but contradict their perſonall will, although they contradict Gods revealed will, theſe men cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:155189:25"/>them to puniſh the innocent, and paſſe by the guilty, and yet no man may ſay to them why doſt thou ſo? to this I ſaid before, that when a King keepes within the bounds that God hath ſet him, he is cloathed with Gods power and authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Deputy, and about his buſineſſe: in this caſe, who may ſay unto him, what doſt thou? Neither is it fitting to ſay to a King thou art wicked, nor to Princes, ye are ungodly, <hi>Iob</hi> 34.18. But when a King goes beyond his bounds, he ſtrips him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of that honour that God had put upon him.

But for this (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>Thy wife ſhal be an harlot, thy ſons &amp; thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhal fall by the ſword, and the land ſhalbe divided by line, and thou ſhalt dye in a polluted land, and Iſrael ſhall goe into Captivity,</hi> verſ. 16.17. <hi>The Phariſees rejected the Counſel of God againſt themſelves,</hi> Luke 7.30. <hi>Shame ſhal be to him that refuſeth inſtruction but he that heareth reproofe ſhal be honoured,</hi> Pro. 13.18. <hi>He that reproveth ſhal afterwards find more favour, then he that flattereth with his lips,</hi> Pro. 28.23. <hi>Nathan</hi> that was ſo plaine with the King, and ſaid, thou art the man, when any trouble aroſe in the Kingdome, ſtill <hi>Nathan</hi> that down-right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man was ſent for: then Kings muſt not free themſelves from all admonition; for, <hi>better is apoore and wiſe child, then an old and fooliſh King that wil be no more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed,</hi> Eccle. 4.13. <hi>The Lord commandeth to ſay to the King and to the Queene, humble your ſelves,</hi> Jer. 13.18. <hi>Then</hi> Daniel <hi>ſaid to the King. breake off thy ſins by repentance, and thine intquity by ſhewing mercy.</hi> Dan. 4.27. Now this admonition muſt be by them that have a calling to it, neither muſt it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reverence, <hi>It is not fit to ſay to a King, thou art wicked, nor to Princes, yee are ungodly.</hi> Job 34.18. But as <hi>Nathan</hi> wiſely gained upon the Kings affections by a parable, and alſo the woman of <hi>Tekoa</hi> another time, <hi>neither be haſty to take up an accuſation againſt an Elder, and itreat him as a father,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.1.19. ſee <hi>Ier.</hi> 40 15 16. When the Preacher ſaw under the ſun in the place of judgment that wickedneſſe was there, and in the place of righteouſneſſe, that iniquity was there, he refers it to God ſaying, <hi>God ſhal judge the righteous and the wicked,</hi> Eccle. 3.16. the uſes follow.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb facs="tcp:155189:26"/> 1. Our duty to Magiſtrates is to think honorably of them; firſt in regard of their office, which we muſt acknowledg to be a juriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> committed to them from God, and therefore to eſteeme and reverence them as the Miniſters &amp; Deputies of God, and let us learne of them that doe ſo as an encouragement of our better obedience to them. Secondly, we muſt honour them from the command of God, which ſaith, <hi>honour the King,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.17. <hi>And the Lord ſaid to</hi> Moſes, <hi>rake</hi> Joſhua, <hi>a man in whom is the ſpirit, and ſet him before the High Prieſt, and before all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and give him charge in their ſight,</hi> that is, tell him the nature and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his office, and charge him to be faithfull in it; and then it followes, <hi>put ſome of thine honour upon him, that all the Congregation of the childen of</hi> Iſrael <hi>may bee obedient.</hi> Numb. 27.18.19.20. And <hi>Solomon</hi> joyntly together commands us <hi>to feare God and the King,</hi> Pro. 24.21. So then <hi>Peter</hi> would have us to have a high eſtimation of them, and <hi>Solomon</hi> joyning them together with God himſelfe, ſheweth that holy reverence and dignity that is put upon them; <hi>Then curſed bee thoſe filthy dreamers that deſpiſe dommion, and ſpeake evill of dignities,</hi> Jude 8. And ſaith <hi>Paul ye muſt needs be ſubject for conſcience ſake,</hi> Rom. 13.5. That is, he would have us free in our obedience to them, without ſlaviſh feare of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, becauſe what is done to them is done to God, yet this honourable calling can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not excuſe the ſins that cleave unto them that are in ſuch places; but the calling it ſelfe is worthy of honour and reverence; then whoſoever be rulers muſt be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with us, and have reverence in reſpect of their being rulers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt not only honour them in our minds, but this muſt be teſtified by our practiſe, in obeying their lawfull proclamations, and in paying tribute, and in taking publique office and charges upon us, that may ſerve for common defence, or any other lawfull commands; <hi>For he that reſiſteth, reſiſtoth the ordinance of God, therefore be ſubject:</hi> Rom. 13.1. Again, ſaith <hi>Paul, warne them that they be ſubject to Principalites and powers, to obey Magiſtrates, and ready to every good worke,</hi> Tytus 3.1. And ſaith <hi>Peter, ſubmit your ſelfe to every ordinance of man for the Lords ſake.</hi> 1. Pet. 3.13. To the King as Supreame, and to other Rulers that are ſent by him, for the puniſtament of evill doers, and for the praiſe of them that doe well and that they may be ſincere in their obedience to them, <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts, that there may be prayers &amp; ſupplications, interceſſions and thankeſgivings for al men for Kings and all in authority, that we may live a peaceable and quiet life, in all, godlineſſe and honeſty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. Now if God doe thus require obedience to Magiſtrates, and he that reſiſteth the office of Magiſtracy, reſiſteth Gods ordinance, then let them know that God will avenge all diſobedience to them.</p>
               <p>After theſe things, when I thought I had finiſhed my worke, I looking about me, ſaw a man approaching towards me, as I thought, to try his power in a ſingle Duel with me, I ſhall deſetibe him as neare as I can. His proper name is <hi>Thomas,</hi> his Sirname is <hi>Nut;</hi> his general calling an <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> his particular I am uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of, yet I ſuppoſe, a wood-cleaver; his deſcent I know not well, but I ſuppoſe him to be one of the children of the old mouſe-catcher, who ſome years agone cryed
<pb facs="tcp:155189:27"/>mouſetraps but when mice grew ſcarce, &amp; his trading failed him, he proffer'd 10. l. to be hang-man; So now wood is ſomething deare, &amp; this man having but litle trading for his axe, would imploy it to cut off men which are of two forts, either the principall members of the body politick, or elſe the living members of the myſtical body of Chriſt as he calls them, viſible ſaints of the ſpiritual Kingdom: the ground on which he would build theſe principles, is <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.8.9. <hi>If thy hand or thy ſoot offend thee, cut them off:</hi> Theſe members (ſaith he) are either the members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy politick, or the members of the body of Chriſt; the firſt of theſe (ſaith he) are ſome principal members of the body politick, as the L. Keeper, which if he offend, being a hand of the body politick, the reſt of the members muſt cut him off: but he dares not to ſtay to tell us what it is that will offend him, leſt hee bee taken and hanged himſelfe, for we know very well what it is that offends Anabaptiſts: Firſt, his very being a Magiſtrate offends them, and for this offence, <hi>Nut</hi> would cut him off if he durſt, although ſuch a member were ſaithfull both to the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: Again, many other things offend them, as the manntaining wars in our own defence is cauſe enough for them to cut off Magiſtrates, as alſo for impoſing a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for reformation, or an oath of Allegiance to Princes: theſe, and ſuch like are great offences that Magiſtrates give to Anabaptiſts, for which, this <hi>Nut</hi> thinkes he may cut them off, were it not that he feares the <hi>Nut</hi>-cracker at <hi>Padington;</hi> well, <hi>Nut</hi> is gone in all haſte from the members of the politicall body to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the myſticall body of Chriſt, and if they offend, the reſt muſt cut them off; neither in this doth he ſhew what it is that will offend him, but it ſeemes for any offence they muſt be cut off, for he hath no healing medicines, but like a butcher he akes his cleaver and chops them off; but I ſhal take the hammer of Gods word &amp; ſplit the ſhel of this <hi>Nut,</hi> and give you a further taſte of the divelliſh kernel that is in it: he ſaith that our Saviour ſpeaketh of a ſpirituall Kingdome, or body, or Church of viſible Saints, but muſt we beleeve this <hi>Nut</hi> when he ſaith that a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all member of Chriſts body muſt be cut off in this manner that here Chriſt ſpeaketh of he would have it to be meant by excommunication, but Chriſt ſaith, <hi>if they be not cut off, the whole body ſhall be caſt into everlaſting fire:</hi> and again, <hi>if they be not cut off, thou canſt not enter into life:</hi> then ſuppoſe a member of Chriſt ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee, canſt not thou be ſaved unleſſe he be damned? again, to take thine owne expoſition, ſuppoſe this offending member ſhould not be cut off by excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt all the reſt of the body of Chriſt be caſt into everlaſting fire? Againe, ſuppoſe ſome of the members be offended, and other ſome be not offended, muſt that member be cut off that offends thee alone, and doth not offend the reſt, muſt that I ſay be cut off, or elſe thou and all the reſt muſt of neceſſitie to hell fire? but in this caſe what wilt thou doe? ſuch a member offends thee and no body elſe, and unieſſe thou cut him off, all muſt to the Divel, neither canſt thou cut him off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the reſt are againſt thee: but is thy ſalvation ſo pin'd upon other mens backs, that if but one faile and be not ſpeedily cut off, all the Anabaptiſts muſt bee caſt into hell fire? this kernel may pleaſe the Divels palat when he goes a Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb facs="tcp:155189:27"/>but I think no rationall man can like the taſte of it: Againe, thou doſt not declare what it is that will offend thee, ſo that I ſuppoſe, if Chriſt himſelfe were here on earth, thou wouldſt be offended at him as ſome others were, <hi>for many were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at him, they eſteemed him as a rock of offence,</hi> Rom. 9.32.33. Againe, thou doſt confeſſe that the body is Chriſt, and ye are the body of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16.12.12.27. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.23.4.12. <hi>And ye are called members of Chriſt,</hi> ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15.12.14. <hi>and members of his body,</hi> Ephe. 5.30.</p>
               <p>Then doth Chriſt ſay, <hi>If my hand offend me, or if my foot offend me, I muſt cut them off, and caſt them from me;</hi> or elſe doth Chriſt ſay, both I all and my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers muſt be caſt into everlaſting fire; and doth Chriſt ſay, if I doe not cut them off, I cannot enter into life? and doth Chriſt ſay, it is better for me that one of my members ſhould periſh, then that I with all my myſticall body ſhould be caſt into hell? neither doth he ſay, if my eye offend me, I muſt pluck it out, nor ſay, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for me with one eye to enter into life, then to have two to be caſt into hell fire; Let thy conſcience ſpeak, thou blaſphemer, and tell me whether it be ſo in thy book: neither is it ſaid, if a hand or foot in Chriſts body offend him, they muſt be cut off; neither is it ſaid, that if the eye of Chriſt offend him, it muſt be plucked out, or elſe the whole body of Chriſt ſhalbe caſt into hel: Then hear the words of Chriſt; <hi>If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and caſt it from thee: for it is profitable for thee, that one of thy members ſhould periſh, and not that thy whole body ſhould be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell.</hi> And ſo, <hi>If thy hand offend thee, cut it off, and caſt it from thee, for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members ſhould periſh, and not that thy whole body ſhould be caſt into hell,</hi> Math. 5.29, 30. So then the meaning of theſe words is this: The members of our body naturall before converſion, do nothing but act ſin; Now of neceſſity that corruption muſt be cut off from thoſe members: and rather then the corruption ſhould not be cut off, let that member periſh, rather then it ſhould abide on thy body to act ſinne; <hi>What, are thy eyes ſo full of adultery that they cannot ceaſe from ſinne?</hi> 2 Pet. 2.14. <hi>Canſt thou not looke on a woman, but thou muſt luſt after her? thou committeſt adultery in thy heart,</hi> (then ſaith Chriſt expreſſely) <hi>plucke it cut, it is profitable for thee,</hi> Math. 5.28, 29. It were better thoſe eyes were out, then ſo to ſin againſt God: yet this muſt not be done till wee have tryed all other meanes, and nothing will reforme this luſting member, as we would do in the like caſe with a tooth, that with paine much offends us: firſt, we try if we can take away the paine and ſave the tooth, but when all means have bin uſed, and we cannot take a way the paine, we had better loſe the tooth, then to be ſo offended with the paine of it. Now the evill of ſinne that is in the eye, ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us as much as the evill of puniſhment in the tooth, and we ſhould uſe all means to remove it, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, <hi>to make a Covenant with his eyes not to looke upon a maid,</hi> Job 31.1. That is, we ſhould bind our eyes with the cords of a Covenant from lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and we ſhould bind our feet from carrying us into temptations, ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.7. And we ſhould keep our mouth as it were with a bridle, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.1. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our ſins are too ſtrong for us, <hi>we ſhould therefore pray the Lord to turne our
<pb facs="tcp:155189:28"/>eyes from beholding vanity</hi> Pſalm. 119.37. Thus when all meanes are uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame our members from ſin and nothing will do it, thou hadſt better plucke out thy eye, and cut off both hands and feet, then to employ them in the ſervice of the Divell to thy eternall ruine of body and ſoule.</p>
               <p>Againe, if wee ſhould loſe a member here, we ſhould have it reſtored againe at the Reſurrection day, therefore that Biſhop who had ſubſcribed with his hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, when the Lord opened his eyes to ſee what he had done, he ſuffered for the truth, and cauſed that hand to be burnt off, which had ſo offended both againſt God, and againſt himſelfe, yet I ſay againe, if it be poſſible, we muſt ſave the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>no man ever yet hated his owne fleſh,</hi> Epheſ. 5.29. For we ſee if a man have got a hurt in his hand or foot, he will uſe all means that may be to heal it, to ſave his hand or foote; but when nothing will do it, he will rather cut it off, then endure the paine, and endanger his whole body: For if one part of the body be in paine, there is no part of the body free, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>if thy eye be evill, thy whole body is full of darkneſſe,</hi> Math. 6.23. That is, if the eye of the body be not good to ſee, the whole body is in danger in all places to be hurt: and ſo the eye of the ſoule which is the underſtanding, if that be not cleare, the ſoule is in danger to be ſplit on many rocks; but let us come to <hi>Nuts</hi> expoſition, which is this, if thine eye be evill, thy whole body is full of darkneſſe: This eye ſaith he, is the Miniſter or the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the which if he be blind, all the Anabaptiſts are blind alſo: and if he be evill, then the reſt cannot be good; he ſaid before, that if one member did offend, he muſt be cut off, or elſe all the Anabaptiſts muſt periſh in hell fire; and here he ſaith, if one be evill, all are ſo, if one be blinde, all are blinde: then I reply upon him thus, that if they be all alike, that if there be one bad, there is none good; then why ſhould another be caſt into hell to ſave <hi>Nut,</hi> when he is as bad himſelfe; wel, Chriſt ſaith, if thy eye, thy hand and thy foot offend thee, do ſo and ſo; but ſaith <hi>Nut</hi> to Chriſt againe, if thy eye, or thy hand, or thy foot offend thee, do ſo and ſo: which ſhewes plainely to all men, that his eye is as blinde as a beetle, to diſcerne ſpirituall things.</p>
               <p>Again, how will <hi>Nut</hi> conſtrue this word, two eyes, two hands, and two feete in the my ſticall body of Chriſt, ſo that if one be cut off, there is but one remaining: and againe, which is the right eye and which is the left in the my ſticall body of Chriſt; I thinke all the braines that is in this <hi>Nut,</hi> knowes not how to give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to theſe things: but ſuppoſe they have two teachers, whom they call their eyes, ſuppoſe one of theſe offend and be excommunicated, and the other dye in the mean time, and ſo leave them all ſtarke blind: <hi>And ſo the blind lead the blind till they all fall into the ditch:</hi> I hope they will not provide more eyes, then they have holes to put them in, ſo that when one is gone, to clap another into the hole; Thus we may ſee the folly of <hi>Nuts</hi> expoſition, who would ſee by another mans eyes, but we muſt all appear before the judgement feate of Chriſt, and receive according to what is done in our owne body, &amp; not according to what was done in another mans body.</p>
               <p>Well thus you ſee that Chriſt here ſpeaketh of our naturall members, that in caſe
<pb facs="tcp:155189:28"/>nothing will take off thoſe ſinfull corruptions that naturally cleave to them, thoſe naturall members had better be cut off in this life, then that the whole man ſhould periſh eternally, ſo that neither politicall, nor myſticall members, but naturall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are meant in this place.</p>
               <p>But will <hi>Nut</hi> ſay it is a great abſurdity, when the body is maimed, that the ſoule ſhould enter into life? In this he declares himſelfe to be as blinde as a beetle, for all the members at the reſurrection ſhalbe reſtored againe perfectly; but this man ſees with another mans eyes, and not with his owne: I may ſuppoſe this is the cauſe why they will not allow of wars under the Goſpell, leſt they ſhould loſe a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ſo go lame to heaven.</p>
               <p>He makes another abſurdity, ſaying, if thoſe corruptions that cleave to our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers offend us, then we muſt cut them off, but if they do not offend us, we muſt not cut them off, and we may enter into life with our corruptions, if ſo be they doe not offend us. I anſwer, men are of two ſorts; either in the ſtate of grace, or in the ſtate of nature; Now for thoſe in the ſtate of grace, who have a new life wrought in them, <hi>and they have given their members as ſervants to Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 6. It muſt needs grieve them when thoſe members ſhall act any ſin, ſaith <hi>Paul, I keepe my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy under, and bring it in ſubjection,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. Yet ſaith he, <hi>this law of ſinne that is in my members, warreth againſt the law of my mind, and againſt his will, leads him into the law of ſin,</hi> Rom. 7.23. Yet when he cannot ſubdue thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in his members, it appeares plainely that they did offend him, elſe what makes him cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me?</hi> verſ. 24. And although it be ſaid, if they do offend, yet t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s is not alwayes a word of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as appeares by ſuch places as theſe. <hi>If God be God, follow him,</hi> 1 Kings 18.21. <hi>If I be a Father, where is mine honour? If I be a Maſter, where is my feare?</hi> Mal. 1.6. If God ſpared not the old world, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. So here, if thy eye, hand or foote offend thee theſe are not words of of diffidence, but of certainty only; the doubt may ariſe from this, whether thou art converted or not, the which if thou be not, thou art dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and paſt feeling, and not capable to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the ſin of thy members: Now theſe are not here in diſpute: <hi>being unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers they are damier already.</hi> John 3.18.

<pb facs="tcp:155189:29"/>
                  <hi>Such a one is able to ſtand againſt all the wiles of the Divell,</hi> Epheſ. 6. But yet the corruptions in all offend them, for none is freed from it in this life, yet ſome keep downe their corruptions more then others, and thereupon have leſſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence from them then others have; but theſe offences it ſeemes, <hi>Nut</hi> is not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, elſe he would not make it a queſtion, whether corruptions doe offend or nor, and ſuppoſing corruptions may be in Gods people, and yet not offend them.</p>
               <p>Another abſurdity, he ſaith, is this, the Saints are commanded to cleanſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from corruptions, to make them ſound; but ſaith he, if corruptions of the members ſhould be here meant, then we may enter into life with one luſt, if we doe but cut off another: and although we be halt and maimed? I anſwer, although the body be maimed, yet the ſoule is not maimed, neither ſhall that maimed body ariſe maimed, but perfect. Againe, the cutting off corruption from the eyes, hands and feete, and from the reſt of the members, neither maimes body nor ſoule, but makes them both more perfect, and if <hi>Nut</hi> were but a rationall man, hee would rather have ſaid that corruptions are as wounds and bruiſes, ſee <hi>Iſa</hi> 1.6. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 38.5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.17. <hi>As the pool of</hi> Betheſda <hi>healed the impotent folke, blind halt, and wither'd,</hi> Joh. 5.3. So the taking away of corruption heals the ſpirituall Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of halt and blind, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>bring in hither them that are poore, maimed, halt and blind,</hi> Lu. 14.21. Now Chriſt ſent for them to cure them, and that was done by taking away their ſinnes and corruptions. <hi>Thy ſinnes are forgiven thee, areſe and walke,</hi> Math. 9.5,</p>
               <p>Thus ſaith Chriſt, but what ſaith <hi>Nut?</hi> he flatly contradicts Chriſt, ſaying, the taking away of corruptions wounds the man, this is <hi>Nut's</hi> expoſition: Again, the text ſaith not that halt &amp; maimed ſhal enter into life <hi>Nut</hi> is much miſtaken to think any ſuch ſhall be in heaven, there is nothing lacking that makes for the happineſſe of the creature, <hi>there is fulneſſe of joy,</hi> Pſal. 16. which could not be if halt or blind were there: well then the words of Chriſt are as an anſwer to a queſtion that might be asked, whether is it better to enter into life wanting a member, or to be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting fire having all the members? Chriſt anſwereth, it is better to enter into life although we want a member: but will it follow hence that if a child of God ſhould loſe a member here, that he muſt needs enter ſo into heaven at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. Other abſurdities he would raiſe from that other tranſlation, <hi>If thy eye hand or foot cauſe thee to offend, pluck it out and cut them off, and caſt them from thee;</hi> and if one luſt cauſe thee to offend, cut that off, but keep ſtill that which doth not cauſe thee to offend; but theſe are meere cavils and anſwered ſufficiently alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. He would gather hence that ſome corruptions will offend, and ſome will not offend: to this I anſwered before, that all men have ſome corruptions, yet ſome men are dead in ſin and paſt feeling, not capable to be offended, others have the life of grace in them, and if their members which are given to Chriſt ſhould be acting ſin, it muſt needs offend them; then are thy naturall members imployed in ſinne againſt God, whether it be the eye to receive ſin to the heart from objects without, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be any other member to act it or to increaſe and improve it; then either that
<pb facs="tcp:155189:29"/>ſinfull luſt muſt off, or elſe that member that acts it muſt off, rather then to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Divels ſervice to ſin againſt God; and if <hi>Nut</hi> trample this under his feet as unſavoury ſalt, it declares plainely that he hath no reliſh as yet of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Nut</hi> moves a queſtion, ſaying, if this be the truth, that hands, feet and eyes be members moſt eminent in Churches. how comes it to paſſe that this truth hath been kept ſecret ſo long? but here by <hi>Nut's</hi> good leave I queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a truth, and it ſeemes he concludes it to be a truth before he hath the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his neighbours, who would have counſelled him better if he had told them that he had ſome carneſt buſineſſe with ſome of the eminent members of the body politick, they would have ſaid to him, doe not goe to the foot, &amp; why not to the foot? becauſe it is not one of the eminent members of the body politick, it is very likely ſome child might have convinced his folly; but then it may be he will reply and ſay, the foot is eminent in the myſticall body, but now turne to the place and ſee how God hath ſet the members in the body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 18. and there you ſhall ſee how he comforts weake chriſtians, ſaying to them, <hi>if the foot ſhall ſay, becauſe I am not the hand I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?</hi> verſ. 15. Again, he ſpeakes to thoſe that are eminent, that they ſhould not deſpiſe the weake ones, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>the eye cannot ſay to the hand, I have no need of thee, nor the head to the feet, I have no need of you,</hi> verſ. 21. Thus you ſee the feet are not the eminent members of the Church, but rather in the meaneſt place of all: now if this be ſo, how will <hi>Nut</hi> prove his truth (he ſaith) hath beene hid ſo long? here I will not proceed to his rotten anſwer, becauſe that will fall together with his rotten foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
               <p>Againe, he ſaith by the way, that Chriſt will allow of no members of his body, Kingdome or Church, but viſible Diſciples: I anſwer with a demand of him, why they are called hidden ones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.3. If they be hidden, they are not viſible, and what is <hi>that white ſtone, and that new name written, which no man knoweth ſave he that hath it?</hi> Revel. 2.17. If no man ſee the writing of Gods ſpirit but themſelves, then ſure they are not all viſible Saints; and why did not the Prophet know that ſeven thouſand that had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal?</hi> and why did not the Apoſtles know the traytor that was amongſt them? Is <hi>Nut</hi> ſo eminent to ſee further into ſpiritual things then Prophets and Apoſtles? and yet I proved him but even now to be as blind as a beetle in ſpirituall things, but to theſe things I ſhall ſpeake more fully when I come to ſpeake concerning baptizing Infants.</p>
               <p>After this, he falls foule upon our Miniſters, ſaying, that none of our Univeriſity Miniſters are faithfull, and that God will reveale his mind to mechanick fooles and babes, rather then to learned Miniſters, and what he did to learned <hi>Paul,</hi> was but one example to ſhew his power; but he hath not promiſed to reveale his will to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more wiſe and learned. To theſe things I anſwer, firſt, they that teach others muſt needs be firſt taught themſelves (faith <hi>Paul</hi> to that young Miniſter <hi>Timothy</hi>)

                  </gap>e; this is the right tradition, and if it be truly obſerved without addition or detraction, the Goſpel will remaine in its integrity; the meanes whereby Chriſt teachetn thoſe that are to teach others, are two; one is by immediate revelation, the other is ordinary inſtruction in Schooles by the meanes and miniſtery of man: now (ſaith <hi>Amos</hi>) <hi>I was no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes nor Prophets Sonne,</hi> therefore not called the ordinary way, but he had his gifts and calling by revelation, <hi>tho Lord ſent me to propheſie to Iſrael.</hi> Amos 7.4. But when revelation is wanting, being an extraordinary calling, then the Schooles of the Prophets remaine ſtill, being the ordinary meanes appointed by God to teach all thoſe that are to teach others; this manner of teaching hath beene from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. The Patriarchs till <hi>Moſes</hi> were Prophets in their Families, not onely in a generall way, but in an eſprciall manner, they taught their firſt borne that they might ſucceed as Prophets after them. Againe, ther were 48. Cities, where not only the people were taught, but alſo Schooles were crected, that they might be taught which were to be Prieſts and Levites, and among the reſt, one was called Kiriath Sepher, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 15.15. That is, ſaith <hi>Perkins,</hi> the Citie of bookes, or as we call it, the Univerſity.

Againe, this teaching is uſeful to maintaine the true interpretation of Seripture, for the right dividing of the word is a matter of great difficulty, and what ever men thinke of it, it requires the greateſt learning in the world. Therefore it is neceſſary that teachere ſhould firſt be taught, and learne the Goſpell of Chriſt, before they teach others. Again, when men began to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the writings of the Prophets and Apoſties, and gave themſelves to ſtudy the writings of men, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

There be ſudry kinds of contention lawful, ſuch as theſe, 1. Contention with an enemy in a juſt wae, 2. Contention at the Bar with an adverſary in a juſt cauſe, 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in diſpuration with an Heretick, 4. Contention in Schooles, diſputation for exerciſe, and for try all ſake.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:155189:30"/>
               <p> The ſeeing teaching of them that are to be teachers is of ſuch antiquity, and to ſo good uſe in the Miniſtery, all men ſhould be exhorted to put to their helping hands that this thing may goe forward. Princes are to maintaine it by their bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulues &amp; authority, as they have done &amp; do ſtil they muſt do it more, &amp; parents muſt dedicate the fitteſt of their children to the ſervice of God in the Miniſtery, and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents rauſt love and affect this calling above all other; <hi>of all gifts deſire rather that ye may propheſie,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.1. And laſtly, all men muſt pray that God would proſper and bleſſe all Schooles of learning where this kind of teaching is in uſe, that the miniſtery may be furniſhed at the leaſt with the original tongues in which the Scripture was firſt publiſhed; for although Chriſt cheſe men into the miniſtery without learning, yet he furniſhed them in an extraordinary manner with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of al tongues &amp; languages, and although they were furniſhed with abundance of grace in their hearts before, yet he charged them to tarry at Jeruſalem untill they had this gift alſo, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. <hi>And on the day of Pentecoſt the holy Ghoſt came upon them, and they began to ſpeake with other tongues,</hi> Acts 2.1.4. But now no Miniſter can look to be ſurniſhed in this manner: they muſt goe the ordinary way now in the Schools of the Prophets to attain to ſo much learning as they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive; this may ſuffice to ſatisfie any rationall man that our Univerſities are lawfull and warrantable, and that the Miniſters of the Goſpell ought to have the knowledge of the original tongues wherein the Scripture was firſt written.</p>
               <p>Again, the calling of the Miniſters ought to be manifeſt, both to their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and alſo to their hearers, and that for divers reaſons; Firſt they are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, and, as it were, the mouth of God to the people; for this cauſe they are to ſpeake in the name of God, and this they cannot doe unleſſe they know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Secondly, the calling of the Miniſtery tends much to edification, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite that he ſhould have the aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit in a large meaſure, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God on him and his Miniſtery, and alſo his hearers ſtand in need of the operation of Gods ſpirit in their hearts; but he that wants the aſſurance of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cannot pray to God in faith for theſe things, neither can he apply the promiſes of God to himſelfe. Thirdly, the knowledge of their callings breeds conſcience of their duties, diligence and the feare of God. Laſtly, the knowledge of their callings in the conſciences of their hearers breeds a reverence in their hearts, and obedience to the miniſtery of the word.</p>
               <p>Now here it may be demanded how they may know that they are called of God to the miniſtery of the word: I anſwer, they may know it if they find three things in themſelves; the firſt is the Teſtimony of their conſciences, that they entred not for praiſe, honour or lucre, but in the feare of God, with a deſire to glorifie him, and to ediſie the Church. Secondly, a faculty to doe that which they have a deſire to doe; in this ſaculty are two things; 1. A knowledg of God and of his ways, 2. Aptneſſe to deliver that which they know. The third thing whereby they may know their calling, is the ordination of the Church, which appeares and gives teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their will and abilitie; he that hath theſe things is certainly called of God:
<pb facs="tcp:155189:31"/>Now put the caſe a man wants the firſt of theſe three, and entred with an evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, being carried with ambitious and covetous deſires: I anſwer, yet his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtill in reſpect of the Church is good and lawfull, and when he repents of his bad conſcience, it is alſo accepted of God.</p>
               <p>So then Miniſters muſt have a calling or elſe they cannot preach, for (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>how ſhall they preach except they be ſent.</hi> Rom. 10.14.15. <hi>No man ought to take that honour upon himſelfe, but he that is called of God as</hi> Aaron <hi>was,</hi> Heb. 5.4. <hi>Vzzah</hi> was ſmitten with death for but touching the Arke, although his intent was but to ſtay it from from falling. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.7. And the men of Bethſhemeſh were ſlaine for but looking into the Arke without a calling, fifty thouſand, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19. therefore the Apoſtles in the front of their Epiſtles declare their calling. This might convince our phantaſtical Anabaptiſts, who think that any man may preach that will, without any ſpeciall calling, and they alledge for their purpoſe, that <hi>the houſe of</hi> Stephanus <hi>addicted themſelves to the miniſtery of the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.15. I anſwer, the meaning of the place is not that they called themſelves but that they ſet themſelves apart to the miniſtery of the Saints, in the purpoſe and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their hearts, of all gifts they deſired to propheſie: yet theſe deſires did not make them Miniſters except God were pleaſed to furniſh them with gifts, and they ordained by the Church; but till then they muſt give me leave to put it out of my beliefe that they were Miniſters. Again, they alledge that all Chriſtians are Kings and Prieſts, and the office of the Prieſt is to teach: I anſwer, we are ſpiritual Kings over our owne corruptions in this world; <hi>For grace reignes through righteouſneſſe, unto eternall life through Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Rom. 5.21. And in this world <hi>wee are a holy Prieſthood to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices acceptable to God by Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. <hi>But when iniquity ſhall have amend, and the Saints are freed from ſin,</hi> Rom. 6.7. <hi>they ſhall inherite all things,</hi> Revel. 21.7. In ſtead of reigning over their corruptions, they ſhall reigne over all the creatures when they are again reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their firſt perfection, as <hi>Adam</hi> did in his innocency, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. The ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> will reſtore them to us perfect againe at the day of judgement, being puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by fire at that day. <hi>For he hath made us Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reigne on the earth,</hi> Revel. 5.10. <hi>And being Prieſts, when the ſacrifice of player ſhall ceaſe, being in full fruition, yet we ſhall offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> Heb. 13.15. <hi>I heard a great voice of much peoole in Heaven, ſaying, Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah, ſalvation and glory and honour and power unto the Lord our God,</hi> Revel 19.1. But this ſhall be when all teaching ceaſeth, when all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ares that did offend are caſt into the furnace of fire, and there are none but Saints. <hi>Then they ſhall not need to teach every one his neighbour ſaying, know the Lord for they ſhall all know me ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 31.34. <hi>Whether there be propheſies they ſhall faile,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.8. Now teaching more properly belongs to the Propheticall office then to the Prieſthood; <hi>Every man ought to covet the beſt gifts, and deſire to propheſie,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.31. &amp; 14.1.5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>9. And thus <hi>Moſes</hi> wiſhed that all the Lords people were Prophets, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.29. but neither <hi>Moſes</hi> nor <hi>Paul</hi> deſired that all were
<pb facs="tcp:155189:31"/>Prieſts to offer ſacrifice; <hi>Vzziah</hi> went into the Temple to burne incenſe upon the Altar of incenſe, but the Prieſts ſaid to the King, <hi>it pertaineth not to thee to burne Incenſe, and the Lord ſmote him with Leproſie,</hi> 2. Chro. 27.16.18.19. But all might propheſie or teach, ſo that they keep within their bounds and limits appointed them, that is, their owne Families. Fathers may teach their children, and Maſters their ſervants, they may command to keep the Sabbath all within their gates; but we being ſpiritual Prieſts maketh nothing to prove that all may teach publiquely. Thirdly, they alledge that the power of the keyes is given to the Church: I anſwer, that it is ſo, yet the uſe and adminiſtration thereof belongs to the Miniſters onely in their diſpenſation of the word; So then none are to meddle in the Miniſtery but they that have a lawfull calling thereunto: Now it belongs to God alone to call men to the miniſtery, Paul <hi>an Apoſtle, not of men, nor by men, but by Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal 1.1. <hi>The Father thruſts forth labourers into the harveſt.</hi> Mat. 9.38. <hi>And the Son gives paſtors and teachers,</hi> Epheſ. 4.11. And <hi>the holy Ghoſt makes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers,</hi> Acts 20.28. And the Churches power and authority to call and ordaine Miniſters is no more but a duty or ſervice whereby they teſtifie and declare and approve of them whom God hath called. Now they are called three waies; firſt by men and not by God, thus all falſe teachers are called. Secondly, when God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth men by the miniſtery of men, thus are all ordinary Miniſters of the word called. Thirdly, when men are called not by men but by Chriſt immediately, and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> and all the Apoſtles were called. Now this laſt manner of calling being extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ceaſed with the Apoſtles; they were not only called immediately, but they were inſpired immediately, and ayded with an infallible aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit, of all this they had promiſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.19.20. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. But now the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way to furniſh them with gifts is the Schooles of the Prophets, and if it pleaſe the Lord to ſanctifie thoſe gifts, and to give them a willing heart to doe ſervice in the Church to the glory of God, and they have a lawfull ordination by the Church, this is the doore of the ſheep-fold, and he that thus enters into the fold of Chriſt is a true ſhepherd of the ſheep, neither may any preach publiquely but he that is thus called and fitted to take ſuch a charge upon him, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. So then it is not for men of other callings; <hi>He that warreth in this warfare muſt not intangle himſelfe with the affaires of this life,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.4. And (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>It is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that we ſhould leave the word of God, and ſerve tables; but we will give our ſelves continually to prayer and to the miniſtery of the word,</hi> Acts 6.2.4. <hi>And who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> 2 Cor. 2.16.</p>
               <p>But it may be they will object theſe words of <hi>Paul; For ye may all propheſie one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.31. I anſwer, this is Schooles diſputation. <hi>If any thinke himſelfe to be a Prophet, or ſpirituall, that is furniſhed with ſpirituall gifts, and have a willing inclination to be a Prophet, to the prayſe of God, and the good of the Church, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandements of the Lord,</hi> verſ. 37. <hi>Let the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſpeake, two or three, and let the other judge: the ſpirits of the Prophets are
<pb facs="tcp:155189:32"/>ſubject to the Prophets,</hi> verſ. 29.32. But here is no encouragement for Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to meddle with the Miniſtery: but they will object, that men of Cyprus and Cyrene, when they were come to Antioch, ſpake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jeſus; <hi>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and turned to the Lord,</hi> Acts 11.20.21. I anſwer, theſe were extraordinarily called and furniſhed immediatly from Chriſt, as the Apoſtles and thoſe 70. Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were: but this manner of calling is now ceaſed, as I ſaid before? but they will object that the Rulers of the Synagogue ſent unto them, ſaying, <hi>Ye men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, ſay on,</hi> Acts 13.15. Hence they would gather, that any of the brethren may preach. I anſwer, thoſe brethren there ſpoken of were certaine Prophet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and Teachers of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> that was called <hi>Niger,</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> and <hi>Manaen</hi> which had been brought up with <hi>Herod</hi> the Tetrarch and <hi>Saul,</hi> or at the leaſt ſome of theſe, as <hi>Barnabas, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> that were their Miniſters, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.2.5. For when that motion was made, then <hi>Paul</hi> ſtood up, and beckned with his hand, &amp; ſaid, <hi>men of Iſrael, ye that fear God give audience,</hi> verſ. 16. So that it was not ſpoken to all the people, but for ſome of them to preach, that were ſent amongſt them by the Church: ſaith <hi>Paul, have not we power to forbeare working,</hi> (for ſo hath the Lord ordained) <hi>that they which preach the Goſpell, ſhould live of the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.6.14. If the Gentiles have been made partakers of their ſpirituall things, their duty is alſo to miniſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in carnall things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.27. So much for the miniſtery alone.</p>
               <p>Next, he blames both the Magiſtrates and Divines that are aſſembled, for two things. Firſt, for going about to reduce all our diſtractions and Schiſmes into one way of worſhipping God I anſwer, there is but one way to heaven, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will gvie them one heart and one way, that they may feare me for ever,</hi> Jer. 32.39. Again, <hi>there is but one body, and one ſpirit, one hope, one God, one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, one faith, one baptiſme,</hi> Epheſ. 4.4. Then why ſhould not all our diſtractions and ſchiſmes be reduced to this one way of worſhipping God, ſeeing all other ways miſſe of heaven? Again, the very end why God ſent Chriſt, <hi>was to gather together in one all things in Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 1.10. And the example of the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>they had all one heart and ſoule,</hi> Acts 4.32. <hi>And</hi> Paul <hi>exhorts to be of one mind, to live in peace, and the God of Peace and love be with you,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.11. Nay further ſaith he, <hi>I beſeech you brethren by the name of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that ye ſpeake the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions among you, but that ye be perfectly joyned together in the ſame minde and in the ſame judgement,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.10. But will not they have our diſtractions and ſchiſmes reduced to one way of worſhipping God, then ſaith <hi>Paul, marke them which cauſe diviſions and offences contrary to the doctrine that ye have learned, and avoid them; for they that are ſuch feare not the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 16.18. <hi>They would lead us from the ancient Prophets to walke in paths, in a way not caſt up,</hi> Jer. 18.15. <hi>Let us enquire for the old way which is the good way, and we ſhall find reſt for our ſoules,</hi> Jer. 6.16. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>we have all one Father, one God created us,</hi> Mal. 2.10. <hi>And Chriſt would
<pb facs="tcp:155189:32"/>have us united in one, as he and his father is one,</hi> Joh. 17.22.23.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing for which he blames the collective body of our Kingdome, for ſuppoſing that the land is ſcourged for this cauſe, that ſo many Religions are ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, affirming the contrary, that the cauſe of judgments, wrath and ſtripes is this, that all Religions are not ſuffered: his reaſon is, firſt ſaith he, the conſciences of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious men are as deare to them as their lives, 2. Hatred will purſue them that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods rule will judge men for their conſciences; this laſt reaſon is grounded upon a falſe foundation, for they do not take upon them to judge the conſcience; we grant with him, that God alone is the judge of conſcience: and I have ſhewed at large, that Magiſtrates do but command the outward man, as his words and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and if they offend herein, they may puniſh them in their bodies and goods, ſo then they may command outward conformity in the worſhip of God, and if they be Hypocrites, it is from themſelves who are not obedient to Gods command, which alone reacheth the heart: It is true, we muſt obey them for conſcience ſake, yet not from their command, but from Gods command, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. Now for his reaſon that is built upon this, he ſaith, what hatred muſt needs purſue them that bring all religions into one, although it may be proved the true Religion; but ſaith Chriſt: <hi>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you: If ye were of the world the world would love his owne: but becauſe I have taken you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you,</hi> John 15.18, 19. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men revile you, and ſay al manner of evil againſt you falſely for my names ſake,</hi> Math. 5.11. But ſaith he, our conſciences are as deare to us as our lives. I anſw. if their conſeience be dearer then Gods word, they may quickly be deluded with a blinde conſcience, and may kill Gods people, and think they do God ſervice, <hi>John</hi> 16.2. And that Strumpet in the <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.20. can wipe her mouth, and ſay ſhe hath done no wickedneſſe; and we ſeldome heare a Malefactor plead guilty; then is conſcience ſuch a perfect rule, or muſt it rule the Word of God, or Gods word rule the conſcience? But he replyes that every mans judgement is truth to himſelfe, as theirs is to them. I grant it, but the word of God muſt rule over all. Neither doe they take upon them to frame a government for the Church, but they ſearch the word, and endeavour to find out that forme that God himſelfe hath ſet down in his word; and I doubt not, but ere long, if they humbly ſubmit themſelves to the Lord, and be aſhamed of their owne wayes, that they have a long time walked in, that the Lord will ſhew them the forme of the houſe, and the faſhion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and all the formes thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the lawes thereof, and write it in their ſight, that they may keepe the whole forme thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them, <hi>Ezek</hi> 43.11. To the great praiſe of his name, and to the comfort of all his people.</p>

               <head>Arguments againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> proving that Infants borne of Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ought to be baptized; with a full anſwer to all their Cavills that are, or can be made againſt it.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, they are part of the Church of Chriſt: I hope if the parents be admitted, the children are not rejected before that they diſcover their deſert to be juſtly caſt out; well, then I take it for granted, that they are reputed members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt; and therefore they ought to be baptized. <hi>For we are all baptized into one body, whether Iewes or Gentiles, bond or free, and have been made all to drinke into one ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12, 13. Then why ſhould Infants be debatred of this benefit which is their due, and Chriſt at his firſt inſtitution of Baptiſme <hi>ſent out his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to baptize all Nations,</hi> Math. 28.19. They were commanded to baptize all Nations: hence I gather, that in the inſtitution of baptiſme, Chriſt made no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nation, age, nor ſexes; but the commandement is ſpoken in a generall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, baptize all, then let us take heed leſt we limit or ſtraighten the command of Chriſt. <hi>And all the countrey of</hi> Judea, <hi>and all the region round about</hi> Jordan <hi>were baptized of</hi> John <hi>in Iordan,</hi> Math. 3.5, 6. But were there no children in all Judea, nor in all the region round about Jordan? or were they not baptized, when it is ſaid all were baptized? I ſuppoſe they will grant that there were children, but they will ſay, they did not come to be baptized: for they that came, confeſſed their ſins, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. I anſwer, if they came not then all did not come; but the Text ſaith, all came. Againe, when multitudes came to Chriſt, they brought their children, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.21.15.38.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Againe, for this word confeſſing their ſins, ſome few might doe it in the name of the reſt, as our Miniſters do every Sabbath day, having children in the congregation: then why may not our children be baptized as well as they?</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Apoſtles practiſe ſheweth, that they underſtood that infants were included in that command of Chriſt; for when they came to any family, if but the parents beleeved, and were baptized, they baptized all the houſhold. <hi>When</hi> Lydia <hi>was converted, ſhe was baptized and all her houſhold. And the Apoſtle told the Iaylor, that if he beleeved on the Lord Ieſus, he ſhould be ſaved and all his houſe; and the ſame houre of the night he took them and waſhed their ſtripes, and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then if the Apoſtles underſtood Chriſt to ſpeak in generall to all Nations, ſexes, and ages without exception, why ſhould we make queſtion of it? ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>marke them which walke ſo, as yee have us for an example,</hi> Phil. 3.15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Infants were circumciſed, and baptiſme is come in the place of it, why then ſhould not Infants of Chriſtians be baptized? did Chriſt come to rob Infants of that benefit which they had before his comming, or did he not rather come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his mercies to them? hee came to breake downe the partition wall, that all might partake of his free mercy, which is not leſſe then it was before, but greater; Firſt, in giving baptiſme in ſtead of circumciſion, which is far eaſier; Secondly, by
<pb facs="tcp:155189:33"/>admitting all Nations to partake of it, which before was to the Jewes onely; 3. In that baptiſme more clearely ſignifies our Regeneration then Circumciſion did; hence I gather, that if Chriſt hath given us a clearer ſignification then before, our children ſhall not have leſſe, if God did not only give Parents the ſeales of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but their Infants alſo; will not God do ſo to Infants of Chriſtians? ſhall we thinke that when Chriſt put his own name upon them, calling them Chriſtians, that he took away part of their benefit? If God made a Covenant with the Jewes for them and their Children, and many gracious promiſes in it, which promiſes &amp; ſeals alſo were made over to their Infants: is this, ſo great a benefit, taken from our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants? did God ſay to <hi>Abraham, I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed alſo,</hi> Gen. 17.19. And the Apoſtle ſaith to their poſterity, <hi>ye are the children of the Covenant which God made with our Fathers.</hi> Acts 3.25. But doth not the ſame <hi>Peter</hi> ſay alſo, that the promiſe is to you and to your children, therefore be ye bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized every one of you? meaning all you that the promiſes belong to; be ye every one baptized, both ye and your children: Then why ſhould not Infants be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? <hi>If but one of the Parents beleeve, the children are holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.14. <hi>If the rootes be holy, ſo are the branches,</hi> Rom. 11.16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Infants may receive the ſeedes of grace by the Almighty power and wiſedome of God, although the manner of working it in them be not known to us: for ſaith Chriſt; <hi>except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdome of heaven; And whoſoever ſhall humble himſelfe as this little child, ſhal be greateſt in the Kingdome of heaven; And whoſoever ſhall offend one of theſe little ones that beleeve in me, &amp;c.</hi> Math. 16.2.3.4.6. Here you ſee by the teſtimony of Chriſt himſelfe, that a little childe is converted and humbled, and beleeving in him; then who dares deny theſe Infants the Sacrament of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme? and ſaith Chriſt further; <hi>Take heed how you deſpiſe theſe little ones, for I ſay unto you, that in heaven they have their Angels alwayes beholding the face of my Father which is in heaven,</hi> verſ. 10. Then doth Chriſt give ſuch a teſtimony o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> them that they are heirs of heaven by all thoſe ſignes and tokens, and ſhall wee as much as in us lyes, bar them out of the Viſible Church? by keeping them from the ſeale of the Covenant that ſhould give them admittance into it, and further Chriſt doth ſtraightly charge them <hi>to ſuffer little children to come unto him, and forbid them not,</hi> Math. 19.24. But doth Chriſt call them and charge them not to keep them backe from him, and dare any be ſo bold to withſtand this charge of Chriſt, and as much as in them lyes, deprvive their ſoules of all ſpirituall good, what deſperate ſoule-murderers be theſe? they are like unto the daughters of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, who in that great famine and terrible ſiege, were more cruell to their ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infants then the ſea monſters, or like the Eſtridges in the wilderneſſe, <hi>Lam</hi> 4.3. The pretious ſons of Sion <hi>comparable to fine gold. were eſteemed as earthen pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> verſ. 2. So theſe men, when Chriſt highly commends, and greatly delights in young Infants, theſe cruell parents think them not worthy of their ſociety in divine ordinances; how doe they know but they were ſanctified in the wombe as well as
<pb facs="tcp:155189:34"/>
                  <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> Jer. 1.5. And how do they know, but they were filled with the holy Ghoſt even from their mothers wombe, aſwel as John the Baptiſt? <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15. But was <hi>Iohn</hi> ſanctified from the wombe, who was the firſt Miniſter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of baptiſme? what is this, but to informe <hi>Iohn</hi> that Infants from the womb are fitted for baptiſme? And again, Chriſt was conceived by the holy Ghoſt to ſanctifie Infancy aſwel as any other age, that none may be excepted againſt; then how dare theſe men make exceptions where Chriſt makes none? then may Infants be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the wombe, and receive the holy Ghoſt from the wombe; Then ſaith <hi>Peter, can any man forbid that theſe ſhould be baptized that have received the holy Ghoſt aſwell as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord,</hi> Acts 10.47, 48.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the Apoſtles did baptize them <hi>that did but in a generall way confeſſe that Chriſt was the Son of God,</hi> Acts 8.37, 38. And they baptized <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> &amp; many in Samaria, when as yet the holy Ghoſt was fallen upon none of them, onely they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus: <hi>Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15, 16.17. And the Apoſtles finding certaine Deſciples, ſaid unto them, have ye received the holy Ghoſt ſince ye beleeved? that is, have ye received the ſpeciall gifts and graces of the holy Ghoſt ſince ye beleeved with a generall faith; but ſay they, we have not ſo much as heard whether there be any holy Ghoſt: and he ſaid unto them, <hi>unto what were ye bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? and they ſaid, unto</hi> Johns <hi>baptiſme,</hi> Acts 19.1, 2, 3. Here you ſee them bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized that can make but a weake account of their faith; why may not Infants born of Chriſtians be baptized much rather then theſe?</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized them with water unto repentance: but ſaith he, <hi>he that commeth after me, ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat. 3.11. That is, when Chriſt by his ſpirit ſhall make that baptiſme by water effectuall by the inward working of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>and yet all this but one baptiſme,</hi> Epheſ. 4.5. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking to thoſe that were baptized with water, and yet were ignorant of the holy Ghoſt, ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> baptizeth unto repentance, and ſaith to the people, that they ſhould beleeve on him that ſhould come after him, that is, on Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>And when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Ieſus, and</hi> Paul <hi>laid his hands on them, and the holy Ghoſt came on them,</hi> Acts 19.5.6. Now this was not another Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, but onely the inward baptiſme of the holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Iohn</hi> had told them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how that he which came after him ſhould baptize thoſe with the holy Ghoſt, which then only received the outward forme, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. Then if this be ſo, why may not Infants of Chriſtians now be baptized unto repentance aſwell as theſe? But our Anabaptiſts will have Chriſt to be the forerunner of <hi>Iohn,</hi> to baptize them firſt with the holy Ghoſt, and then <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhall baptize them with water, and ſo Chriſt ſhall prepare the way for <hi>Iohn,</hi> and not <hi>Iohn</hi> for Chriſt; <hi>But the ſpirit is like the wind, and we cannot tell whence it commeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e for that we ſhall never know in mother; ſo then to
<pb facs="tcp:155189:34"/>children borne of Chriſtian parents we are to doe our duty in baptizing them, and let the Lord alone to take his own time to make it effectual to them; we muſt not tye the Lord to convert them, to any limited time of their age; ſome the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts in the firſt houre, and ſome not till the laſt houre of their life. Again, it is ſaid when Chriſt was baptized and went out of the water, then the ſpirit of God deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon him, <hi>and a voice from heaven came ſaying, this is my beloved ſon in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> Mat. 3.16.17. Then if we would ſee the work of God appear upon our children, let us firſt baptize them, and then we may looke for it and not before.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, we may take notice of the two Sacraments of the Jewes compared with ours, and their agreement together: firſt, concerning their Paſſeover, it was required that they ſhould know the thing ſignified by it, and that they ſhould ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and cleanſe themſelves before they did receive it; and when King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſuppoſed that ſome of ſeverall Tribes had not ſufficiently prepared themſelves, and yet had been at that Sacrament, he prayed for them, ſaying; <hi>The good Lord pardon them, and the Lord hearkened to</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>and healed the people,</hi> 2 Chron. 30.18.19.20. And (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) concerning ſome that were defiled and had not cleanſed themſelves, therfore they could not keep the Paſſover on that day, <hi>Num.</hi> 9.6. Now to this Paſſover our Lords Supper doth well agree, which requires examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and knowledge of the thing ſignified, and a remembrance of the death of Chriſt till his comming againe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. But for the other Sacrament of the Jewes, was nothing required of them if ſo be they were but children of circumciſed Jewes, and baptiſme is come in the place of it? why then ſhould more be required of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren then was of the children of the Jewes? let them anſwer if they can.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe they ſhould require ſome qualification in our children, why may we not anſwer that children are the heritage of the Lord? <hi>Pſa.</hi> 127.3. then why ſhould they be kept from this ordinance of baptiſme? Again, children were in the Temple and ſang Hoſanna to the ſonne of <hi>David</hi> to the aſtoniſhment of the Prieſts and Scribes, yet to the great approbation of Jeſus Chriſt, who ſaid to the Prieſts, have yee not read <hi>that cut of the monthes of babes and ſucklings thou haſt perfected praiſe,</hi> Mat. 21.15, 16. Pſa. 8.2. But doth Chriſt here acknowledge an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall perfection to be in the praiſe of babes and ſucklings? then who dares to keep them from the ordinance of baptiſme? Again, Chriſt ſaith, of ſuch is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, then who dares to make queſtion of that which Chriſt affirmes? and he kindly embraced them, which he would not have done if they had not beene part of his Kingdom, neither could he be deceived, becauſe he knew their hearts, and he prayed for them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.13. and his prayers were alwaies heard, Luke 11.42. neither would he pray for the world, but only for thoſe that were given him, 17.9. and he bleſſed them; but who are bleſſed of Chriſt but they whoſe ſinnes are forgiven? <hi>Pſa.</hi> 32.1. And Chriſt was diſpleaſed with thoſe that kept them from him, which plainly ſhewes his tender affection to them; and he gave his Apoſtles a double charge, that they ſhould neither forbid thoſe that brought them, nor drive
<pb facs="tcp:155189:35"/>way, but freely give them admittance into his preſence; and (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Hee that receives not the Kingdom of Heaven as a litle child, he ſhal not enter therein;</hi> and (ſaith he) <hi>their Angels are in heaven beholding the face of my Father which is in heaven,</hi> that is, they ſtand ready, and hearken for a command from God to bee ſent for their good, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 103.20. But the angels are miniſtring ſpirits onely for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>re a Title to the Kingdome of heaven. But they will ſay, thoſe in the Goſpell are to be underſtood babes in Chriſt or young converts: To this I anſwer, <hi>when they brought them to Chriſt, he tooke them up in his armes when he bleſſed them,</hi> Mat. 10.16. which ſhe wes plainely that they were litle children. Secondly, the Diſciples call them young children and litle children <hi>ver.</hi> 13. and <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, they brought unto him Infants, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.15. <hi>And when Chriſt called a litle child unto him,</hi> Mat. 18.2. <hi>he ſet him in the midſt of them,</hi> which argues plainely that he had him in his armes; but ſee <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.36. there you ſhall ſee in plaine words that he took that very child in his armes and ſpake unto them. Thirdly, Chriſt ſaith unto his Diſciples, who were ſtrong Chriſtians; <hi>except ye be converted and become as litle Children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> but now will thoſe men who ſay this place is meant of babes in Chriſt or young converts, will they I ſay make their inference thus, that ſtrong chriſtians muſt become weak in faith? yea the Apoſtles muſt become as babes in Chriſt, their ſtrong faith muſt become weake againe, or elſe they cannot enter into heaven; <hi>theſe men declare their folly as</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>delareth her ſin,</hi> Iſa. 3.9. For doth not Chriſt often blame a weak faith, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.26.14.31. and doth he not highly commend a ſtrong faith? <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.10.15.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. Then the true meaning is this, the Diſciples had beene reaſoning who ſhould be the greateſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.1. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.34. then Chriſt tooke a young child in nature up in his armes to convince their pride and envy, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>in malice be ye children, but in underſtanding be ye men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. So here in pride and envy Chriſt would have them to be as children, ſaying, except yee bee converted from your pride and envy yee cannot be ſaved; that is, your pride and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy muſt be mortified &amp; crucified w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> makes you affect high places; <hi>he that would be firſt, the ſame ſhalbe laſt &amp; ſervant of all,</hi> Mar. 9.35.36. So, then the Diſciples were already converted from the ſtate of nature to the ſtate of grace, but yet they were not ſufficiently converted from their pride &amp; envy; ſo then you ſee all theſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Chriſt to be concerning young children in nature, and not of young converts being growne in age; therefore infants having ſuch approbation and teſtimony from the mouth of Chriſt, I ſay againe, who dares hinder them from the ordinance of baptiſme?</p>
               <p>Eightly, from the ends of baptiſme, which are theſe. Firſt, it is a pledge unto us in regard of our weakneſſe, to aſſure us of all the graces and mercies of God, &amp; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of our union with Chriſt, and of remiſſion of ſins, and both mortification of them, and vivification to ariſe from them to newneſſe of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3.4. <hi>For
<pb facs="tcp:155189:35"/>he that is baptized into Chriſt, hath put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.27. The ſecond end of our baptiſme is to diſtinguiſh Chriſtians from Tuckes and Pagans; for it is a ſigne of our Chriſtian profeſſion againſt all the enemies of Jeſus Chriſt, as Circumciſion was a token of the Covenant, ſaith the Lord, between me and thee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. Chriſtians may ſay as <hi>David</hi> did; <hi>Thy vowes are upon me O God, I will render praiſe unto thee,</hi> Pſal. 56.11. The third end of our baptiſme, it is a meanes of our entrance or admiſſion into the viſible Church of Chriſt, for ſaith Chriſt; <hi>Except a man be borne of water and the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God,</hi> John 3.5. The Kingdome of God here hath a double ſignification anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the double qualification: ſometimes it is meant the viſible Church; ſo then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be baptized with water, he cannot enter into it, &amp; it is alſo meant heaven it ſelfe, and ſo a man muſt be borne of the holy Ghoſt, or elſe he cannot enter into it. The fourth end of our baptiſme, it is a meanes of our unity with the Church and people of God; <hi>For we are all baptized into one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. <hi>There is one body and one ſpirit, and one hope of our calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptiſme, one God and Father of all, who is above and through all, and in you all,</hi> Epheſ. 4.4, 5, 6. Then would you have a pledge of Gods love to you in regard of your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that they are united to Chriſt, and their ſins forgiven and mortified, and that they are riſen with Chriſt to the life of grace? then let them be baptized.</p>
               <p>And would you have them diſtinguiſhed from the enemies of Chriſt, and to have a ſigne and a badge of their Chriſtian profeſſion before the world? then let them bee baptized.</p>
               <p>And would you have them to be admitted into the Viſible Church of Chriſt? then let them be baptized.</p>
               <p>And would you have them to enjoy the priviledges of the Church, and to be at peace and unity with the people of God? then let them be baptized.</p>
               <p>But ſome will here demand, whether baptiſme be of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or not; I anſwer, to make covenant with God, and to be in the ſaid covenant, is of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation, for unleſſe God be our God in Covenant, and we his ſervants, we cannot be ſaved; now baptiſme is the ſeale of this Covenant, and therefore neceſſary but in part; 1. In reſpect of Gods command, who hath enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us to uſe it, 2. In reſpect of our weakneſſe that have need of all helper that may confirme our faith: yet baptiſme is not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation. For the want of baptiſme doth not condemne the children of beleeving Parents, if they dye before baptiſme, when it cannot be had; for they being holy, theirs is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, although they dye before baptiſme; the thiefe upon the croſſe, and many other holy Martyrs dyed before baptiſme, that are now in the Kingdome of heaven; and thoſe parents that ſlighted this ordinance, ſo that their children dyed without it, if they repent of that ſin, it may be forgiven, and their ſoules may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for all that, yet it is of very dangerous conſequence to ſlight or contemn any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, it is damnable of it ſelfe without repentance. There was a law in Iſrael, that the uncircumciſed man-child, whoſe fleſh of his foreskin is not circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb facs="tcp:155189:36"/>that ſoule ſhalbe cut off from his people; the reaſon is rendred, becauſe ſaith the Lord, <hi>he hath broken my Covenant,</hi> Gen. 17.14. Now it was not the Infant that deſpiſed or ſlighted the Covenant: but it was the parents that ſinned, by ſlighting or deſpiſing the ordinance of God, and did procure this judgment upon their child; alſo the childe when he came to age refuſed to be circumciſed; and ſo hee broke the Covenant of God, and therefore he was cut off from the people; and why may not this be a juſt judgement of God upon the Parents neglect of the ordinance of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme which is come in the place of circumciſion? And if the Lord were ſo ſevere with thoſe that were not circumciſed, which was a heavy burden for Infants to beare, ſee <hi>Ezod.</hi> 4.26. How much more now baptiſme is come in the place of it, which is far eaſier; <hi>But waſh and be cleane,</hi> 2 Kings 5.13. Then let them take heed how they neglect this ordinance of God: for when they expect to have them anſwer for themſelves, they may juſtly anſwer with contempt, and deſpiſe the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and ſo for ever be cut off from his people, and from the viſible Church, and ſo by that meanes debard from the ordinary means of ſalvation. <hi>For the Lord addeth to his Church daily ſuch as ſhalbe ſaved,</hi> Acts 3.47. Yet I grant that place is chiefly to be underſtood of the Inviſible Church, into which who ſoever ſhall enter, being the Kingdome of grace, ſhall without faile come to the Kingdome of glory for ever. <hi>But except a man be borne of water,</hi> that is, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with water <hi>he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God</hi> here, which is the viſible Church, and he that is entred into it is either in the inviſible or in Gods way to it, which is nothing elſe but heaven begun, and heaven is nothing elſe but grace perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. <hi>We al with open face beholding as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, &amp; are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the ſame Image from glory to glory, even by the ſpirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. But they will object and ſay, that Infants cannot be knowne to us that they are indeed the children of God, and if they be not, ſay they, we may not to baptize them. I anſwer, the ſame may be ſaid of men of yeares, for we know not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether they be the children of God or no: therefore by this argument we may not only exclude Infants from baptiſme, but men of years, yea all ſexes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from both Sacraments, and ſo admit of none at all into the Church of God. But to come a little nearer to them, do they beleeve that the patents are the children of God, and in Covenant with him? then they ought to beleeve the ſame of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren till they manifeſt by their wicked life to the contrary. For is God the God of the Parents and not the God of their ſeed? this is flat againſt the tenor of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; Therefore if the child have a right to the Covenant, he muſt needs have a right to the ſeale of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they object that Infants have no faith, and therefore baptiſme is of no uſe to them. I anſwer, they may have the ſeeds of faith and regeneration, although we know it not; <hi>For without faith it is unpoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. <hi>And he that beleeveth not ſhalbe damned,</hi> Mar. 16.16. But howſoever they have an infolded faith, becauſe that their parents by their faith receive the promiſe of God both for themſelves and their children, ſo that the faith of the Parents is alſo the
<pb facs="tcp:155189:36"/>faith of their children. And th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> to be born of Chriſtian parents, and in the Church of Chriſt, is in ſtead of the profeſſion of faith, and ſo it wil be uſefull and profitable for Infants to be baptized.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they will object that Infants know not what is done when they are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. I anſwer, no more did thoſe Infants that were circumciſed, yet it was uſefull to them and their parents both to have the Covenant ſealed unto them, and is it not the ſame alſo to Chriſtian Infants? many benefits come with it, it is a meanes to admit them into the fellowſhip of the viſible Church, and by that meanes made right members of it. For as the Father makes a purchaſe for himſelfe and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and they being Infants at the time of the ſealing of it, and ſo not able to know what was done, yet the purchaſe is not in vaine for them; but as thoſe Infants grow to underſtanding they can rejoyce that they have an intereſt in their Fathers pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe; ſo will Infants baptized, when they come to underſtanding they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the great love of God that ſhould vouchſafe to take them into Covenant, and ſeale ſo many gracious promiſes unto them in the Sacrament of baptiſine, which will be an engagement to them all their days, to endeavour to keepe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they will object that the weakneſſe of the Infant is ſuch, that the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the water to be dived into it, may be the death of the Infant; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay they, it were better to let them grow to more ſtrength, and to take the warmneſſe of the Summer ſeaſon, rather then to endanger the life of the Infant. I anſwer, it is true that dipping the child doth more reſemble our ſpirituall waſhing, for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we are buried with him by baptiſme into his death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walke in newneſſe of life. If we be planted in the likeneſſe of his death, we ſhalbe in the likeneſſe of his reſurrection,</hi> Rom. 6.4.5. But there is no neceſſity of dipping the Infant to endanger the health and life of it in theſe cold countries, when as the word baptizing ſignifies not only ſuch a waſhing that is by diving of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into the water, but that alſo which is by ſprinkling water upon it, and the Lord ſaith by the Prophet, ſpeaking of theſe times under the Goſpell. <hi>Then will I ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle cleane water upon you, and ye ſhalbe cleane from all your ſilthineſſe,</hi> Ezek. 36.25. Therefore without all queſtion in theſe cold Countries ſprinkling is accepted.</p>

Again, we are taught to pray the Lord to keep us out of temptation, and we have the example of <hi>David's</hi> fearfull fall into adultery and murder by ſeeing a naked woman waſhing her ſelfe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Abſtaine from all appearance of ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Now if they ſhould object that men growne in yeares that were ſtrangers were circumciſed when they were converted to the Jewes Religion, therefore it was no ſhame to ſee their nakedneſſe: I anſwer, none but males were to be circumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.17.
<pb facs="tcp:155189:37"/>ſee 35.15. and it was done by men; but females were not circumciſed, neither ought they to circumciſe any; but both ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es are to be baptized, therefore we ſhould have regard to modeſty, and to keep out of temptation.</p>
               <p>Fifly, it may be they will object and ſay, if the Infant be ſprinkled but on one part and not on another, then it is baptized but in one part and not in another, and therefore no true baptiſme: I anſwer in the words of Chriſt, <hi>if I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me;</hi> yet ſaith he to <hi>Peter he that is waſhed needeth not ſave to waſh his feet and is cleane every whit,</hi> John 13.10. Here <hi>Peter</hi> thought it had beene better to be waſhed all over: but the anſwer of Chriſt is, that one part is ſufficient, and circumciſion was not in all parts but in one part, and yet the Infant was by the vertue of that one place circumciſed all over; So Baptiſme doth infuſe it ſelfe into all parts of the man, and into all parts of his life, and into all places whitherſoever hee comes; therefore that baptiſine that is by ſprinkling the Infant is a true baptiſme, and I have already ſhewed the danger of neglecting this ordinance: and here I may tell you againe, that the Lord met <hi>Moſes</hi> and ſought to kill him becauſe that his child was not circumciſed, thereupon his wife in her rage and fury went her ſelfe and circumciſed him which was her great ſin; <hi>yet the Lord in his great mercy paſſed by all becauſe the thing was done, and ſo the Lord let him goe,</hi> Exod. 4.24, 25, 26. then take heed of carnall reaſoning againſt Gods ordinance. Then I conclude, that in hot Countries and for men of yeares, diving may rather be uſed; but in cold Countries and to Infants, ſprinkling may ſuffice, which alſo is the cuſtome of our Churches and ought not altogether to be deſpiſed, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>if any man ſeeme to be contentious, we have no ſuch cuſtome, neither the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God;</hi> and when Iſrael had no ſetled Church, but travelled from one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to another, in ſuch a caſe circumciſion might be laid aſide, and yet did not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Lord; <hi>But he remembers their kindneſſe when they followed him in the wilderneſſe, then Iſrael was holineſſe to the Lord, and the firſt fruits of his increaſe.</hi> Jer. 2.2, 3. Although they laid circumciſion aſide for a ſpace of time; and there is much difference betweene a ſetled Church and the firſt planting of the Goſpel; when the Apoſtles preached, it was to men of yeares, and ſuch they baptized that were preſent, and they were out of the Covenant; but we are children of Chriſtians, and ſome of our fathers were in covenant with God and had the ſeale of it, which is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: <hi>And we are the children of the Covenant which God made with our fathers,</hi> Acts 3 23. Theſe things well conſidered, let the Reader judge whether God will accept the ſprinkling of Infants at their receiving of Baptiſme in this cold Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, they object that the baptiſme of Infants is grounded upon no inſtitution of Chriſt: I anſwer, that Chriſt ſent his Apoſtles to baptize all Nations, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles practiſe where they came baptized whole houſholds, as I ſhewed before; and the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the whole Church, ſaith, <hi>we are all baptized into one body.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. And the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Iſraels going through the red Sea, ſaith, <hi>they were all baptized in the ſea,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.3.4. Now if all Nations, all
<pb facs="tcp:155189:37"/>Houſholds, and all the Church was baptized, where will they find that Infants were excepted againſt to be debarred of this ordinance of God? Let them but with an upright conſcience tell me what they think, whether Infants be no part of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Houſholds, or of the Church of God, and then tell mee whether baptizing of them bee not grovnded upon the inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>ly, they object &amp; ſay, that place in <hi>Mar.</hi> 18. is not meant of infants, but of good big ones w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> were able to goe &amp; anſwer for themſelvs: this I have anſwered already, but ſaith Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Inſtitutions 416.7. they are called by the Evangeliſt <hi>Brephe</hi> and <hi>Paidia,</hi> by which words the Greekes doe ſignifie babes yet hanging. on the breaſts, therefore this word (<hi>to come</hi>) is plainely meant, to have acceſſe; loe (ſaith he) what ſnares they are compelled to make which are hardned againſt the truth: &amp; where they ſay that the Kingdom of heaven is not given to Infants, but to ſuch as be like them, but this is no ſounder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt; for the very intent &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chriſt is to ſhew that Infants in age are not ſtrangers to him, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth that Infants be ſuffered to have acceſſe unto him; nothing is plainer then that very infancy indeed is there ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, &amp; where he addeth, <hi>of ſuch is the Kingdom Heaven,</hi> in this word ſuch, are meant very Infants themſelves and ſuch as be like them. Now to compare thoſe actions and carriage of Chriſt to thoſe infants with the ſignification of baptiſme together, and it will appeare to have the ſame ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Then if Infants be brought to Chriſt, why is it not meet that they ſhould be received to baptiſme which is the ſigne of our communion &amp; fellowſhip with Chriſt? and if the Kingdome of Heaven be theirs, why ſhould the ſigne thereof bee denied them? whereby there is as it were an entry made into the Church of God, that ſo they may be numbred among the heirs of the heavenly Kingdome; and by our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme we teſtifie that Infants are contained in the Covenant of God; and doth not that which Chriſt did to them the ſame? his receiving and imbracing, laying his hands on them &amp; praying for them, doth not all this declare that they are his, &amp; that they are ſanctified of him? for (ſaith he) <hi>I pray not for the world, but for thoſe that thou haſt given me out of the world,</hi> John 17.9. Then how unjuſt are they which drive a way thoſe whom Chriſt calleth unto him, and ſpoile them that Chriſt hath gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with his gifts? and if they ſhut out them that he willingly receiveth, what miſerable cruelty is this to their litle Infants, let the Reader judge. <hi>Shal not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants under the old Teſtament be denyed the ſeale which the Lord calleth a token of the Covenant betwixt him and us?</hi> Gen. 17.11. And ſhall Infants now be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it? ſhall the Jewes be aſſured of the ſalvation of their ſeed, and ſhall it be taken away from Chriſtians? did Chriſt by his comming take away the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Infants, and leave us none in ſtead of it? what an extreame ſlander is this to Chriſt who came to put an end to all darke Types and ſhadowes, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to the ſons of men the infinite goodnes of the Father more clearely then ever it was before: <hi>Chriſt is the light of the Gentiles, Luke</hi> 2.32. Then let us not think that Chriſt came to deprive our children of that which the children of the Jewes had before his comming.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:155189:38"/>
               <p> Eightly, they will object and ſay, that it is no where found that any one Infant was ever baptized by the hand of any of the Apoſtles. I anſwer, although it be not expreſly by name ſet downe by the Evangeliſts, yet it is plainly implyed, when it is ſaid that they baptized <hi>Lydia</hi> and her houſhold, and the Jaylor and all his, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15.23. But if all this will not ſuffice to anſwer them, I reply, that by the ſame argument women may be debard from the other Sacrament the Lords Supper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that we read of none that received it in the Apoſtles times: but if we obſerve and conſider well what the inſtrution requireth, by that we may know to whom the uſe of the Lords Supper ought to be communicated; now the ſame rule is to be obſerved in baptiſme, for when we conſider to what end it was ordained, we may eaſily ſee that it belongs aſwel to Infants as to elder folks; ſo that if they be deprived of it, the will of Chriſt is manifeſtly defrauded, then lot us not beleeve their lyes, when they ſay that baptiſme of Infants was not in the Apoſtles times. <hi>But try the ſpirits whether they be of God,</hi> 1 John 4.1. <hi>And ſearch the Scripture daily, and ſee whether thoſe things be ſo,</hi> Acts 17.11.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, they will object that although Infants were Circumciſed, yet it will not follow that they ſhould be baptized, becauſe that the ſigns &amp; the Covenant are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and alſo the names of the children. For firſt ſay they, Circumciſion was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of mortification &amp; not of baptiſme; ſo I ſay too, that mortification is the thing ſignified by both: hence I conclude that baptiſme doth rightly come in the place of Circumciſion, becauſe that they both do ſignifie the ſame thing. 2. Whereas they affirm the difference of the Covenant, they are forced to wreſt the Scriptures with audacious boldneſſe, and all becauſe they would make them ſpeake a damnable lye which is this. They ſay that the Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> did not exceed this temporal life, &amp; al the promiſes therein contained are but for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things; but if this be ſo, hence it wil follow that the Jewes were only filled with benefits like ſwine fatted with huskes, and ſo at length did periſh with eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: for ſay they, Circumciſion was but a litterall ſigne, and the promiſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were but carnall. To this I reply, that Hereticks may draw the ſame inference from baptiſme, for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we are circumciſed in Chriſt in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh by the Circumciſion of Chriſt,</hi> (and preſently he addeth) <hi>buried with him in baptiſme,</hi> Col. 2.11, 12. Thus you ſee that baptiſme is directly in the place of Circumciſion, and the fulfilling of baptiſme is alſo the fulfilling of Circumciſion, for they figure unto us both the ſame thing, yet I deny not but the land of Canaan with many temporall bleſſings, was infolded in this promiſe, yet not as the chiefe, which was Chriſt, and in him all ſpirituall and eternall bleſſings, <hi>that the bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come on the Gentiles through Ieſus Chriſt, that we might receive the promiſe of the ſpirit through faith,</hi> Gal. 3.14. Thus thoſe ſoule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> murderers do not only ſeek to murder our little Infants, but alſo the ſoules of all the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God under the old Teſtament, in ſaying that Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was but litterall, and all the promiſes contained in it were but for carnall things. 3. They ſay that in the old Teſtament they were called the
<pb facs="tcp:155189:38"/>children of <hi>Abraham</hi> becauſe they carne of him, and now none but the faithfull are called <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, therefore ſay they that carnall Infancy which was by Circumciſion grafted into the fellowſhip of the Covenant figured the Infants of the new Teſtament which are regenerated by the word of God to immortall life. This is a truth, but yet it is not the whole truth; for as the Serpent beguiled <hi>Eve,</hi> ſo doth this ſubtile Sophiſter ſeek to ſeduce thoſe little ones that beleeve in Chriſt. 1. Here you ſee that he excludes all our Infants from having any right in Chriſt, becauſe ſaith he, the circumciſing of Infants, and receiving them, or ingrafting them into the fellowſhip of the Covenant, ſignified thoſe under the new Teſtament, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by the Word, which no Infant can be; yet I have proved before that they may have the ſeeds of faith &amp; regeneration wrought in them by the ſpirit of God, although the manner how it is wrought in them be hidden from us: then why ſhould he exclude theſe Infants? Again, he calls them all carnall Infants that were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed before that they manifeſt themſelves ſo to be; not conſidering that God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſanctifie them, and to give them the gifts of the holy Ghoſt from their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, as I have ſhewed in <hi>Ieremiah</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt. Again, <hi>Abraham</hi> was called the Father of the faithfull, aſwell to Jewes as Chriſtians; for when a company of wicked wretches called themſelves the children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>if ye were the children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>you would do the workes of</hi> Abraham; <hi>Ye are of your father the Divell, and the luſts of your father ye will doe,</hi> John 8.39.44. <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>rejoyced to ſee my day, and ye goe about to kill me, this did not</hi> Abraham, <hi>verſ.</hi> 56.40. Againe, <hi>all the faithfull, whether Iewes or Gentiles, are all joynt heirs with</hi> Abraham <hi>of the ſame promiſes, and ſhall come from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſit downe with him in the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> Mat. 8.11. ſo then by Circumciſion the Jewes were taught that God was the author of their ſalvation, &amp; by this knowledge their minds were raiſed to the hope of eternal life, they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods peculiar treaſure, and his purchaſed people, and what can be wanting to them when God hath taken charge of them. <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>had faith before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, that he ſhould be the father of all the faithfull, both of circumciſion and uncircumciſion,</hi> Rom. 4.10.11. Yet God was pleaſed particularly to imbrace the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> with his mercie, and that the ſame mercy might be the more witneſſed to them, he gave them the ſeal of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion ſo like unto this is the Chriſtian Church when the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts receive the ſeal of the covenant, ſo muſt the children alſo; <hi>For if the root be holy, ſo are the branches,</hi> Ro. 11.16. <hi>Yea, if but one of the parents beleeve, the children are holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.14. And are ſo accounted of God although they be Infants, and not yet capable to be converted by the word of God preached unto them, yet they may have a work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by the holy Ghoſt, which makes them to be in the Covenant, and to have right to the ſeale of it which is baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, they object other differences to ſmall purpoſe betweene baptiſme and circumciſion; they ſay that baptiſme hath relation to the firſt day of our ſpirituall battell, but circumciſion to the eighth day when mortification is ended, and by &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:155189:39"/>by they fall ſoule upon themſelves and break the neck of their owne argument, ſaying that circumciſion is a ſigne of the fleſh to be mortified, and baptiſme they call buriall, into which none can be put till they be already dead, ſo that it is enough and ſufficient to confute them in naming their owne contradictions; but let them know that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi rend="sup">th</hi> day becauſe that ſhould be the laſt day of mortification; but God in great mercy to the infant did forbeare the firſt ſeven dayes becauſe they are held to be moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as alſo that it may have a litle more ſtrength to undergoe ſo hard a ſervice and alſo it was to typifie our Saviours reſurrection. Another filly cavill they would make, that if we thus compare baptiſme with circumciſion, then ſay they, none but males ought to be baptized, and yet (ſay they) you baptize females: I anſwer, circumciſion being in the generative part, it is all one as if both were circumciſed, ſo that if but one of the parents were in the Covenant, as I ſaid concerning baptiſme, the children are holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. Thus then we ſee the agreement between cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and baptiſme in the inward myſtery and in the promiſes; in the uſe and in the efficacy of them: Then why may not infants now be baptized aſwell as they were circumciſed, it being far eaſier to them to beare it?</p>
               <p n="11">11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>ly, they object that infants underſtand not the thing there ſignified, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is their ſpirituall regeneration, this (ſay they) cannot be in their tender infancy, therefore they are to be taken for no other then the children of <hi>Adam</hi> till they bee growne to age meet for a ſecond birth: I anſwer, if they have the ſeeds of faith and regeneration wrought in truth by the ſpirit of God in their ſoules, although the knowledge of it be hidden both from themſelves and from us; it is too weake an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to deprive them of the ordinance of baptiſme; for ſometimes the ſtrongeſt Chriſtian may thinke himſelfe a caſt-away, and that he for the preſent hath not one dram of true ſaving grace as yet wrought in him, but muſt we judge him to be ſo, becauſe he himſelfe for the preſent cannot ſee it to be otherwiſe? ſo then muſt wee judge all Infants to be in old <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe they themſelves are not capable to underſtand their own condition? If they be in old <hi>Adam,</hi> they are in the ſtate of death and damnation. <hi>And if they ſhould then dye, they muſt needs be damned; for in</hi> Adam <hi>all dye,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. But will theſe men leave them in that condition? what is this, but as I ſaid before, to eſteem the precious ſons of Sion comparable to fine gold, to be but earthen pitchers? <hi>Theſe are more cruell then ſea monſters to their young ones, like the Eſtridges in the wilderneſſe,</hi> Lam. 4.2.3. <hi>She is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt her young ones, as though they were not hers, becauſe God hath deprived her of wiſedome, and hath not imparted unto her underſtanding,</hi> Job 39.16.17. Chriſt calleth them unto him, becauſe he is life, and that they might have life in them, and theſe people drive them from him, and adjudge them to death. Neither will they bring them to Chriſt that they may have life; they will not uſe the means to have them ingrafted into Chriſt, that ſo they may be delivered from the bondage
<pb facs="tcp:155189:39"/>of death; they deprive them of all ſalvation, in debarring them from the ordinance of baptiſme. But they will demand how Infants can be regenerate, which have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge of good nor evil. I anſwer, God is able to work the ſeeds of grace in them, although we ſee it not, and in this thing we muſt beleeve more then we ſee, or elſe we ſhal condemn all thoſe infants that die before they be capable of knowledge, and ſo <hi>David</hi> ſhall go to hell to his departed Infant; for ſaith he, <hi>I ſhall goe to him,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.23. And how can it be avoyded? <hi>For we are all ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin we were conceived,</hi> Pſa. 51.5. We are all by nature children of wrath, then thoſe Infants that dye, muſt be freed from the wrath of God, and from the guilt of original ſin, or els they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſaved. But here is our comfort, God can ſanctifie <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> in the womb, &amp; he can give <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt the gifts of the holy Ghoſt from the womb, and why not our Infants aſwel as they? Chriſt was conceived by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt in the wombe, that he might ſanctifie his elect in every age, aſwell at the firſt hour of their life as at the laſt, if he pleaſe: ſo then elect children ſhall be made holy and regenerate before they depart this life. And although the word preached be the immortall ſeed to regenerate men of years, it is not ſo to Infants, neither hath the Lord ſo tyed himſelfe only to that means, but he may uſe ſome other in caſe that cannot be had, as among Turkes and Pagans, nor received by Infants; yet we muſt not limit the holy one of Iſrael, nor ty him to ordinary means in extraordinary caſes.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But they object that baptiſme is a Sacrament of repentance and of faith w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> cannot be in Infants, and we ought to beware leſt they being admitted to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of baptiſme, the ſignification of it be made voyd. I anſwer, it is evident by Scripture that Circumciſion was a ſigne of repentance; yet <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>the ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith,</hi> Rom. 4.11. So then if Infants among the Jewes had faith to ſeale, why may not Infants of Chriſtians have the like; I mean the ſeeds of faith; therefore baptiſme is not void and of no effect to them. Again, if circumciſion was commanded, baptiſme is implyed, that is, come in the place thereof, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the ſame thing, and inſtituted by the ſame authority. Then let them take heed how they rage againſt the ordinance of God; and although Infants that were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed had no actuall repentance, yet they were truely Circumciſed into the mortification of their corrup and defiled nature, in which mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation they ſhould afterwards exerciſe themſelves when they were grown to riper age; and ſaith <hi>Iohn, I baptize you with water unto repentance,</hi> Mat. 3.11. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were baptized had not received the holy Ghoſt, for as yet he was faln up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on none of them, only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 8.16.17. So then they were baptized into repentance and faith to come, for as yet theſe graces be not found actually in them, yet by the ſecret working of the ſpirit of God, the ſeede of both lies hid in them. <hi>Paul</hi> calls this <hi>the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I anſwer, Circumciſion had a command, and baptiſme is come in the place of it; then let them ſhew how and when that command was repeated; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb facs="tcp:155189:40"/>the ſigne be changed, the command remaines ſtill, as it was to Circumciſion, ſo it is now to baptiſme. Again, if they be elected and have this ſigne of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſhall depart before they be capable to underſtand the myſtery of it, they ſhal be renewed by the power of the holy Ghoſt unconceivable to us, before they goe hence &amp; be no more ſeen: but if they grow up to age, whereby they may be taught the truth of baptiſme, they wilbe the more engaged to endeavour reformation of their lives, having the token or ſigne of regeneration given them from their Infancy; ſaith <hi>Paul, we are buried together with Chriſt by baptiſme,</hi> Rom. 6.4. If this be done by baptiſme, then it was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That they might hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth live unto Chriſt; and ſaith <hi>Peter, baptiſme is the anſwer of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards God by the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.21.</p>
               <p>But they often erre in this, that they will have the the thing it ſelfe alwaies in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time before the ſigne; But if this were ſo, then Infants could not have beene circumciſed, for they could not manifeſt to others their regeneration being Infants, but circumciſion was to them the witneſſe of good conſcience, the ſeeds of grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there but the declaration and manifeſtation, was applyed to the time to come; ſo alſo baptiſme is to confirme and eſtabliſh the Covenant made by the Lord with us, and we then receive the ſeale thereof; and when wee actually believe being of age, <hi>then we ſet to our ſeale that God is true,</hi> John 3.33.</p>
               <p n="13">13. They object that baptiſme is given unto forgivenes of ſins, but this we grant as wel as they, for we are al born ſinners, &amp; ſtand in need of pardon from the womb, and alſo of she ſigne of it to aſſure us, as ſoon as it may be had, ſeeing the Lord doth not cut off Infants from the hope of mercy, why ſhould we deprive them of the ſigne which is far inferiour to the thing it ſelfe? ſo then Infants have remiſſion of ſins gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, therefore they ought not to have the ſigne taken from them. They ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that Chriſt cleanſeth his Church by the waſhing of water by the word, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. And this alſo we grant aſwell as they, for it quite overthrowes their errour. For if the Lord will have that waſhing whereby hee cleanſeth his Church to be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by baptiſme, why then ſhould we do ſo much wrong to Infants as to debar them from that which is given in generall to all the members of the Church; <hi>And they alſo are heirs aſwell as others to the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> Mat. 18.34.19.14. And baptiſme is an ingrafting into the body of Chriſt; then Infants who are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among the members, ought alſo to be baptized, leſt we be found guilty of this horrible ſin, to pluck away by violence any member from the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="14">14. They object that the Apoſtles baptized none but thoſe that did before make profeſſion of faith and repentance For they ſaid unto <hi>Peter</hi> and to the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>men and brethren what ſhall we doe?

Hence they conclude that baptiſme is to be granted to none but tooſe that have ſaith and repentance given before. I anſw. The firſt of theſe places doth not
<pb facs="tcp:155189:40"/>mention ſaith at all, ſo that it ſeems by that place repentance alone may ſuffice, and the other place doth not mention repentance, ſo that it ſeems from that place, that faith alone may ſuffice, ſo that of neceſſity the two places muſt be joyned together; but if you goe to joyne Scriptures together, we will joyne with you, and lay ſome other Scriptures to them both, which will ſoone ſplit your argument; for theſe to whom <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> ſpake, were men of yeares, and ſufficient to have the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of repentance, and to conceive faith. Now ſuch as theſe, we grant, ought not to be baptized till we conceive of their converſion and faith ſo far as it may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the judgment of men, but the caſe of Infants is to be accounted otherwiſe, as for example; When any ſtranger joyned himſelfe in communion with the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Iſrael, they taught them firſt the Covenant of the Lord, &amp; inſtructed them in his law before that he was marked with Circumciſion, becauſe that he was by birth a ſtranger to the people of Iſrael, with whom the Covenant was made, and with whom Circumciſion was eſtabliſhed. The Lord when he adopted <hi>Abraham</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, doth not begin at Circumciſion, and hide from him what he meant by that ſigne, but firſt he declareth what Covenant he intendeth to make with him, &amp; then after faith is given to apply the promiſes, then he maketh him partaker of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Circumciſion; but why muſt <hi>Abraham</hi> firſt have faith, and then receive this Sacrament; and yet his ſon <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhalbe partaker of it at eight dayes old? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, becauſe that he was a man grown in years, and before a ſtranger: therefore it was meet that he ſhould firſt learn the conditions of the Covenant, our <hi>Iſaac</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant begotten of him, is in Covenant by right of Inheritance according to the forme of the promiſe, which was not only to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that his ſon had right to it from the wombe, although he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not the conditions thereof being an Infant, neither ought ſuch Infants to be debard from the ſigne, for this that they cannot ſwear to the form of the Covenant. So then if heathens which are grown in age ſhall embrace the faith of Chriſt, they muſt not bee marked with baptiſme till they doe evidently declare their faith in Chriſt, and repentance for their ſins, which only can open to them an entrance into fellowſhip of the Covenant: but Infants of Chriſtians as they are received of God into the inheritance of the Covenant as ſoon as they are borne, ought to be received to baptiſme; but if a Turk or a heathen ſhall offer himſelfe to baptiſme, he muſt not be raſhly baptized of us till after confeſſion, whereby he may ſo ſatisfie the Church.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:155189:41"/>them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.20. Hence I gather fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their own expoſition, thus, that although they do as Chriſt did who lived 30 years before that he was baptized, &amp; al that time have bin taught to reform their lives, yet by their own expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they muſt not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve &amp; do what Chriſt here commands them till they be baptized, becauſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; reformation are ſet downe after baptiſme in this place. Then ſeeing they fall thus foule upon their own expoſition, that they muſt not obſerve &amp; practiſe till they be baptized, in my judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it were good to have the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> baptized betime, that they may begin reformation betime, that they may not only be taught 20 or 30 years, but they may obſerve and practiſe what they have been taught. But here all may ſee what unprofitable hearers they make of their children, who ſhall heare before baptiſme, becauſe that teaching is ſet downe firſt, but they muſt not obſerve and practiſe till after baptiſme becauſe that is ſet down laſt, neither will they baptize them that they may obſerve and practiſe. Here I may repeat againe what I ſaid before, that the Apoſtles were ſent amongſt heathens that are out of the Covenant, but we are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the Covenant; and they were men of age, but ours are Infants not capable of teaching. But do they ſtand ſo much upon this, that teaching is ſet down firſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though obſervation be ſet down after baptiſmein the ſame place? then let us to this joyn another, <hi>Io.</hi> 3.5. ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. where Chriſt doth not ſay <hi>except ye be born of the ſpirit firſt, and then of water afterwards, ye cannot enter into the Kingdome of heaven;</hi> but contrary he ſaith, <hi>except ye be borne of water, and then of the ſpirit,</hi> ſhewing that baptiſme muſt give them admittance into the viſible Church of God here, and they muſt be borne of the ſpirit, that is, regenerated, before that they can come into God heavenly Kingdom, and we know that many were baptized before that they had the gifts and graces of the holy Ghoſt given them, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.16.17. Again, they being ſent to teach thoſe that were capable of teaching, &amp; then to baptize them; but will it follow hence that Infants muſt be firſt taught and then baptized? becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> was ninety and nine yeares old when he was circumciſed, muſt <hi>Iſaac</hi> be ſo too? a pretty concluſion. But I have anſwered it already, and proved it too weak an argument to debar Infants born of Chriſtians from the ſeale of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: but further let me cleare this by a ſimilitude, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>this we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you, that if any will not worke, neither ſhould they eat,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.10. will they hence conclude that the Apoſtle will ſuffer none to eat but ſuch as worke? then what ſhall our aged people and Infants doe, and our ſick and weak and lame peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doe? ſhall we ſtarve them all becauſe they cannot worke? this is our Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts divinity, who make that a generall rule for all, which is ſpoken only of ſome; for (ſay they) becauſe men of yeares muſt be inſtructed before they be baptized, therefore Infants muſt be ſo too, and becauſe men growne &amp; in health and ſtrength muſt worke or elſe they muſt not eat, therefore infants muſt doe ſo too, or elſe they muſt not eat. Now for the example of Chriſt, who they ſay was not baptized till he was 30 years of age, I hope they will not ſay that he wanted fitneſſe till he was of that age to be baptized, for <hi>when be was but twelve yeares old he disputed with the Doctors in the Teme, pl and all that heard him were aſtoniſhed at his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:155189:41"/>and anſwers,</hi> Luke 2.42.46.47. Then the reaſon why Chriſt was not baptized till the middle of mans age or till he was 30 years of age, was, becauſe he was minded then with his Doctrine to inſtitute baptiſme; and that he might procure the greater authority to his inſtitution, he ſanctified it with his owne body, who was baptized to ſanctifie that ordinance unto us, <hi>and he ſent out his Apoſtles to baptize all Nations in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat. 28. <hi>Though Ieſus himſelfe baptized not,</hi> meaning with water, becauſe (ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt) <hi>he that commeth after me ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat 3.11. Thus Chriſt did then to many, as alſo now when he make to that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance effectuall to the cleanſing of their foules from ſin; but if they ſtand ſo much upon the thirtieth yeare, why then did they ſuffer <hi>Gervetus</hi> one of their great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to begin at the age of one and twenty years to boaſt of himſelfe to be a prophet? and they ſuffered him to take the place of a teacher before that he had been a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Church.</p>
               <p n="16">16, they object, that if Infants be baptized, they may aſwell receive the Lords Supper: I anſwer, no, that will not follow, for the Scriptures ſhew us a large difference betweene thoſe two; baptiſme is a ſigne of admiſſion whereby they are numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people of God; &amp; it is a ſigne of ſpirituall regeneration, whereby wee are born again the children of God, whereas on the other ſide the Lords Supper is given to men growne in years, and therefore able to beare ſtronger meat; and whereas the Scripture never ſaith that any infants born of chriſtian parents are unfit for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, yet none muſt receive the Lords Supper but ſuch as diſcerne the body and blood of the Lord, and are able to examine their owne conſcience, and able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Lords death; the Apoſtle exhorteth that <hi>every man ſhould prove and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelfe and then eat of that bread and drinke of that cup;</hi> therefore examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt go before, which were a vaine thing to looke for from infants: againe, <hi>he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelfe, not diſcerning the Lords body.</hi> But if none can partake worthily but they that can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Lords body, why then ſhould we give to our tender children poyſon in ſtead of lively food? Again, the commandement is, <hi>that ye ſhall doe it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> and that other ſentence, <hi>as often as ye eat of this bread and drinke of this cup, ye doe ſhew the Lords death till he come:</hi> but what remembrance can bee required in our infants of the thing which they never attained with underſtanding? what preaching of the croſſe of Chriſt can they comprehend in their mind? none of theſe things are preſcribed nor required in baptiſme, therefore between theſe two ſignes there is great difference, and it was ſo between circumciſion and the paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the old Teſtament; for circumciſion (which is well knowne to anſwer our baptiſme) was appointed for infants, but the paſſeover which our Lords Supper ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded did not receive all manner of gueſts without difference, but it was rightly ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by them only that were of age, &amp; did enquire into the ſignification of it. Theſe things methinks might ſatisfie theſe men if they were not wilfully blinded and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately bent to goe on in their errour.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:155189:42"/>
               <p> Now it may be demanded whether the children of Turkes of Jewes may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be baptized. I anſwer, no, becauſe their parents are out of the Covenant, ſo that the caſe is not the ſame as with Infants borne of Chriſtans, with whom God hath made a Covenant, and with their ſeed who are children of the Covenant. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we our ſelves have right to the ſeale of this covenant, ſo have our Infants as ſoone as they are borne, although the Lord in mercy did forbeare eight dayes to the Jewes, becauſe they were then unable to beare it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be demanded whether children of profeſſed Papiſts may be baptized. I anſwer, their parents are baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt; and though the Papacy be not the Church of God, yet the true Church of God is hidden amongſt them, and for this cauſe baptiſme remaines ſtill in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their children may be baptized, yet with theſe cautions. Firſt, that their parents deſire this baptiſme. 2. That there be Churches which promiſe the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the child in the true ſaith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it may be demanded whether the children of prophane and wicked pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents who hold the true religion in their judgement, but deny it in their lives, may the children of ſuch be baptized? I anſw. They may for all that: for without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>they that were of circumciſed lewes were circumciſed,</hi> Gen. 12.23. Although many were wicked, yet al were circumciſed. Again, although our immediate parents were wicked, yet it may be ſome of our predeceſſors were holy, <hi>and if the roote bee holy ſo are the branches,</hi> Rom. 11.16. This alſo may anſwer a queſtion whether the children of fornication may be baptized. I anſw. They may, if ſome beſides their parents will anſwer for their good education: neither is there any reaſon that the ſins of the parents ſhould hinder the child of baptiſme being a thing pertaining to life eternall.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It may be demanded whether children of excommunicate parents may be baptized. I anſw. as before, that if ſome will anſwer for their good education, they may; for the parents although excommunicated, yet ſtill they remain for mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, having ſtill a right and title to the Kingdome of heaven, &amp; are not abſolutely caſt out of it, but with this condition, if they do not repent; although in part they are in reſpect of their communion or uſe of their liberty, yet not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their right and title; but as a free man of a corporation being impriſoned, remains a free man ſtill, although for the time he hath no uſe of his liberty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It may be demanded whether the intention of him that baptizeth be neceſſary; I anſwer, if the word of inſtitution come to the element, it is a Sacrament, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Miniſters intention be. <hi>Paul rejoyced that Chriſt was preached, although many preached of envy &amp; contention, with no deſire of any good to their hearers,</hi> Phil. 1.16. Then the intention of the mind is not neceſſary, if ſo be the inſtitution be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And the efficacy of the Sacrament depends not on the will of man, but on the will of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It may be demanded what is the duty of the Miniſter in baptizing. I anſw. he ſtands in the room of God, &amp; what he doth according to the inſtitution, is as much
<pb facs="tcp:155189:42"/>as if God himſelf had done it with his own hand, and therefore when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter doth apply water to the body which is the ſigne and pledge of grace, he doth withall apply the promiſe of remiſſion and life everlaſting to the party baptized, &amp; that is as much as if God ſhould ſay to the party baptized, calling him by his name, I freely give unto thee the pardon of all thy ſins, and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, upon condition that thou keepe the order ſet downe in baptiſme, which is to turne unto me, and to beleeve in Chriſt; then here is ground for a ſpeciall ſaith. Firſt, God for his part by hand of the Miniſter applyes the promiſe of mercy to every particular beleever; then againe, every particular beleever is by a ſpeciall faith to receive the promiſe. For when God ſhall ſpeake unto us particularly, and as it were aſſure us of his mercies with his owne hand and ſeale; we muſt needs be moved in our obedience to his will, and our hearts muſt be affected with it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It may be demanded whether baptiſme adminiſtred by wicked men or Hereticks or ſuch as cannot preach, be lawfull and true baptiſme. I anſwer, if ſuch a one be choſen and put in the place of a true Paſtor, and keepe the true forme of baptizing according to the Inſtitution in the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, it is true baptiſme: but if they baptize in the name of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is unlawfull; for were ye baptized in the name of <hi>Paul? I thanke God I baptized none of you, leſt any ſhould ſay that I baptized in my owne name,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.13.14, 15. Theſe things conſidered, although they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and could not preach, or wicked Hereticks that did adminiſter it, yet their baptiſme was lawfull. For the Phariſees and Doctors of the Jewes were many of them not of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> but of ſome other Tribes, and many of them were Hereticks and Apoſtates, yet they were in the place of good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chaire, and taught ſome of <hi>Moſes</hi> doctrine; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith Chriſt, heare them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It may be demanded by the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> who are not pleaſed with our baptiſme, whether thoſe that we have baptized, may not be baptized againe by them. Such <hi>Katabaptiſts</hi> were in <hi>Calvin's</hi> time, that did furiouſly cal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to be baptized againe. To this I anſwer, that they may not be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed againe, being once baptized; the efficacy of baptiſme extends it ſelfe to the whole life of man, and we are but once new borne, and once ingrafted into Chriſt, and the gift of regeneration is never extinguiſhed; if a man could be borne againe, he ſhould need to be baptiſed againe, becauſe that baptiſme is the Sacrament of Inciſion or ingrafting. Now if any ſhould ſay that a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that is ingrafted into Chriſt, ſhould by his own ſins and wickedneſſe make himſelfe a dead member, I ſhould tell that man, it is unpoſſible. <hi>For the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Temple is made of living ſtones,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. <hi>And they are paſſed from death to life.</hi> John 5.24. <hi>And beleevers are of the houe and fleſh of Chriſt that can never dye more,</hi> Epheſians 5.30.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb facs="tcp:155189:43"/> 9. It may be demanded what ſeale or marke is ſet on Gods people by this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>acrament of baptiſme? I anſwer, there is a two-fold ſeale, one outward, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e other inward. The outward and viſible marke or ſeale is to diſtinguiſh Chriſtians from Turkes, Jewes, and Infidels; as the blood of the Paſcall Lamb did betweene the Iſraelites and the Egyptians. Now the inward or inviſible marke or ſeale that is ſet upon us in baptiſme, being effectuall, is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our election; this baptiſme being effectuall, ſhewes unto us that the foundation of God remaineth ſure, <hi>having this ſeale, the Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. By vertue of this, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I know my ſheepe,</hi> John 10. <hi>And by this the elect of all nations are marked,</hi> Rev. 7.9. The ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſeale is the gift of regeneration, which is nothing elſe but the imprinting of the image of God in the ſoules of men, and by this beleevers are ſealed, <hi>Epeſ.</hi> 1.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. Now baptiſme is a meanes to ſee this marke in us, becauſe it is the laver of regeneration: for as the water waſheth away the filth of the body, ſo the thing ſignified which is the blood of Chriſt, doth waſh away the ſin of our ſoules.</p>
               <p>Here I thought to have ended this diſcourſe concerning baptiſme, being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I ſuppoſe, ſufficient to ſatisfie the Reader; but I looking about me, ſaw one <hi>Servetus</hi> a mighty Anabaptiſt, the glory of their company, he came matching with his twenty arguments, and he ſet upon me and forced me to give him Battell. Firſt (ſaith he) the ſignes of Chriſt are perfect, therefore (ſaith he) they that receive them muſt bee perfect, or at leaſt able to conceive perfection: But here this man is a litle too haſty to require perfection the firſt day; ſaith <hi>Paul, not as though I were already perfect, but I follow after and preſſe toward the marke,</hi> Phil. 3.12, 13, 14. Baptiſme extendeth it ſelfe throughout all our life till death, therefore we muſt grow unto perfection in degrees. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſaith, the ſignes of Chriſt were ordained for remembrance, that every man ſhould remember that he was buried together with Chriſt, but here the man hath left his baptiſme and is fled to the Lords Supper, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24.25. Thirdly, he ſaith, all they abide in death which believe not the Sonne of God, and the wrath of God abideth on them, and therefore infants which cannot believe, lie in their damnation: I anſwer, Chriſt only threatneth the deſpiſers of the Goſpell, which proudly and ſtubbornly refuſe the grace that is offered them; but what is this concerning infants? ſaith Chriſt, <hi>it is not the will of your heavenly Father that one of theſe litle ones ſhould periſh,</hi> Mat. 18.14. But how can this be if they he ſtill in damnation under the wrath of God? no, the ſpirit of God can worke the ſeeds of grace in them although wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive the maner how it is done. 4. he objecteth that we are firſt in our natural condition. therefore we muſt tarry for baptiſme which is ſpiritual: It i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> true, <hi>we are ſhapen in iniquity, &amp; conceived in ſin,</hi> Pſ. 51. <hi>And by nature children of wrath,</hi> Epheſ. 2.3. But by his good leave, God is able to remedy this even
<pb facs="tcp:155189:43"/>in Infancy, as I ſhewed in <hi>Ieremiah</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt. Fiftly, then he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an allegory, ſaying, <hi>David</hi> tooke neither blind nor lame, but ſtrong ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with him into the Tower of Sion, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.8. But here I ſhall ſplit his allegory with a parable of Chriſt, wherein God calleth to his heavenly ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet both the blind and the lame, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.21. Sixtly, then he bringeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther allegory, ſaying, that the Apoſtles were fiſhers of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.19. <hi>And leſus ſaid unto Simon, henceforth thou ſhalt catch men, and not litle children,</hi> Luke 5.10. To this I reply, and demand what that ſaying of Chriſt meaneth, <hi>that into the net of the Goſpell are gathered all kind of fiſhes,</hi> Mat. 13.47. Neither were the Apoſtles when they were ſent to preach forbidden to baptize Infants, and when the Evangeliſts name them <hi>Anthropous,</hi> men, which word comprehends all mankind without exception; why then ſhould they except againſt Infants, when as God makes no exceptions againſt any Age, Sex, or Nation? Seventhly, he ſaith, ſith ſpirituall things agree with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, therefore Infants, which are not ſpirituall, are not meet for baptiſme: I anſwer, here <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of Doctrine, where the Corinthians were very quick to apprehend carnall things, and blames them to be very dull to conceive ſpirituall things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13.14. But what is this to infants, which are not required to heare points of Doctrine, is any thing here to hinder them from baptiſme? He replies, that if they be new men, they muſt be fed with ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all food: I anſwer, the ſigne of Adoption may ſuffice till they be growne of age and able to beare ſtronger meat. But he objecteth, that Chriſt calleth all his to the holy ſupper: I anſwer, he admitteth none but them that are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy prepared to celeb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>te the remembrance of his death; this infants cannot doe, yet Chriſt doth vouchſafe to imbrace them, which argues they are not ſtrangers, although Chriſt hath ſtronger meat for them, yea <hi>many things hee hath to ſay to them which they cannot beare now,</hi> John 16.12. Eighthly, hee ſaith, it is monſtrous that a man after he is borne ſhould not eat: I anſwer, the ſoule may be fed although they doe not eat outwardly of the ſupper; Chriſt is meat to infants though they abſtaine from the ſigne, which is the ſupper; but of baptiſme the caſe is otherwiſe, for by it alone the gate into the Church is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to them. Ninthly, he ſaith, a good ſteward diſtributeth meat to his houſhold in due time: I grant it, but then withal let him prove that baptiſme is given to infants out of due time. Tenthly, he bringeth the commandement of Chriſt, <hi>to make haſte into the harveſt, for the fields are already white,</hi> John 4.35. I anſwer, from this place Chriſt would have his Apoſtles to take notice of the preſent fruit and good ſucceſſe of their labours, that they may the more cheerefully prepare themſelves to teach becauſe they were fitted to heare; but I ſay againe, what doth this concerne Infants to keep them from baptiſme?</p>
               <p n="11">11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> reaſon, he ſaith, in the firſt Church Chriſtians and diſciples were all one: It is true, thoſe that were converted and baptized were both Diſciples
<pb facs="tcp:155189:44"/>and Chriſtians; but what of this? will he gather hence, that infants borne of Chriſtians are ſtrangers and out of the Covenant? let him prove it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. He alledgeth that all Chriſtians are brethren, but infants are out of this number ſo long as we debar them from the ſupper: I anſwer, Infants are heirs of the Kingdome of Heaven; <hi>for of ſuch is the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 19.14.18.14. <hi>And they are members of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. And the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of Chriſt was a true token of their adoption, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.15. Thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are joyned in common with full growne men; therefore although they abſtaine from the ſupper for a time, it hinders not, but that they pertaine to the body of the Church.</p>
               <p n="13">13. He addeth that none is made our brother, but by the ſpirit of adoption which is given only by the hearing of faith; this objection hath been often an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that it is ſpoken of men of yeares which is not required in Infants: this hearing of faith, but is this ſufficient to prove that God neither will, nor can bring home any of his elect, but by the ordinary meanes of the Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched? ſhall we ſhut all the world out of heaven, becauſe they have not this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes of ſalvation as we have? why then ſhall we limit the holy one of Iſrael, as though he were not able to graft Infants into Chriſt by his ſpirit, becauſe the manner how is hidden from us.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Hee objecteth that <hi>Gornelius</hi> was <hi>baptized after hee had received the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 10. But what of this, becauſe one was ſo, muſt all be ſo? I have ſhewed the contrary by many examples, read <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15.16.17. The holy Ghoſt was faln upon none of them; <hi>Yet they were baptized in the name of the Lord Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. Here this blaſphemer ſaith, by regeneration we are made Gods, and that they be Gods to whom the word of God is ſpoken; This, ſaith he, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not to children that be Infants. All that I will ſay at this time to this damnable errour, is this, to ſhew their helliſh inference from ſome places where Kings and Magiſtrates by reaſon of their offices are called Gods, being his Vice-gerents or Deputies upon earth. Hence they would gather that all the ſaithfull are deified that they may the better baniſh Infants out of the Church.</p>
               <p n="16">16. He ſaith that Infants cannot be accounted new men, becauſe they have not been begotten by the word. This I have often anſwered to belong to men of yeares, yet Gods ſpirit can worke without the ordinary meanes.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Here he brings another allegory, ſaying, in the Law a ſheep &amp; a goate were not offered in ſacrifice as ſoone as they came out of the wombe. Here I might anſwer, <hi>that the firſt born of man and beaſt was conſecrated to the Lord as ſoon as it came out of the wombe,</hi> Exod. 13.2.</p>
               <p n="18">18. He affirmeth that none can come to Chriſt but they that have beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepared of <hi>Iohn.</hi> I anſwer, had thoſe Infants beene with <hi>Iohn</hi> whom Chriſt embraced and bleſſed? away with ſuch falſe principles.</p>
               <p n="19">
                  <pb facs="tcp:155189:44"/> 19. Here he calleth for Patrons, ſuch as <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> and the <hi>Sibylls,</hi> to prove that holy waſhing pertaine to none but them that are grown of age: here this man diſcovers his honourable eſteeme of the baptiſme of Chriſt, who will reduce it to the Ceremonies of the Gentiles, that it may be no otherwiſe adminiſtred then pleaſeth <hi>Triſmegiſtus,</hi> but we more eſteem the authority of God, whom it hath pleaſed to make Infants holy to himſelfe, and to admit them with that holy ſigne, the force whereof they did not yet underſtand: neither do we count it lawfull to borrow any thing out of the cleanſings of the Gentiles, that may change in our baptiſme the everlaſting &amp; inviolable law of God which he hath eſtabliſhed concerning circumciſion.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Laſt of all he maketh this argument, that if it be lawfull to baptize In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants without underſtanding, that baptiſme like an interlude may be in ſport adminiſtred of boyes when they play. But of this matter let him quarrell with God, by whoſe commandement Circumciſion was common to Infants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they had attained to underſtanding: was it therefore a thing to bee played with, or ſubject to the follies of Children, that they might overthrow that holy ordinance of God? but it is no marvaile that thoſe reprobate ſpirits although they were vexed with frenzie, do thruſt in all the groſſeſt abſurdities for defence of their errors, becauſe God doth with ſuch giddineſſe juſtly take vengeance of their pride and ſtubbornneſſe. So much for the 20. arguments of <hi>Servetus,</hi> and his brethren the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One objection I find ſince which is this, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne all that they baptized to make profeſſion that they had juſtifying faith, although they had it not. I an. Chriſt ſaid, <hi>ſome of you beleeve not, for Ieſus knew who they were that beleeved not,</hi> John 6.64.66. And the Apoſtles ſay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves that the holy Ghoſt was faln upon none of thoſe in <hi>Samaria, yet they were baptized in the name of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> Acts 8.16. Then ſhall we think that Chriſt and his Apoſtles would enjoyne them to make profeſſion of a lye, to ſay they have juſtifying faith when they had it not? or did Chriſt and his Apoſtles engage themſelves to beleeve that the baptized had juſtifying faith, when they knew the contrary, and ſo beleeve a lye againſt their owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? But they diſplay their folly and reply, ſaying, the knowledge of Chriſt was above the rule, and therefore he might cauſe them to make profeſſion of a juſtifying faith, though he knew they had it not; but what blaſphemy is this to make Chriſt the author of their diſſembling? and not only ſo, but a deſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler himſelfe, to profeſſe that they had juſtifying faith, which, ſay our <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> was the cauſe of baptiſme, when he knew they had it not? Hence we may gather that knowledge of ſin gives free toleration of ſinne; for Chrſt knew they had no juſtifying faith, yet he might baptize them. But this is no rule, ſay our <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> for other Miniſters, becauſe they do not know that they have no juſtifying ſaith, as Chriſt did; ſo then by the doctrine of <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:155189:45"/>if our Miniſters know that Infants have no faith, they may baptize them; but if they doe not know that they have no juſtifying faith, then they muſt not baptize them.</p>
               <p>Now all ſober-minded men may ſee how raſhly they trouble the Church of Chriſt with brawls and contentions for baptizing of Infants; but it will be profitable to conſider what Satan goeth about with this ſo great ſubtilty, even to take away from us the ſingular fruit of affiance and ſpiritual joy (which is to be gathered hereof) and to diminiſh alſo the glory of the goodneſſe of God: for ſweet it is to godly minds to be certified not onely by word, but alſo by ſight to our eyes of the great favour that we have obtained of our heavenly father both to us and our poſterity. How ſhould this ſtirre up thankfulneſſe, that God is not only in Covenant with us, but with our ſeed after us? this thankeſgiving and praiſe unto our God for this mercy, is the thing that Satan ſeeks to hinder by depriving our Infants of this ordinance of baptiſme. Now if Satan could hinder this aſſurance of the grace of God to our Poſterity, he would ſoone ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle all the promiſes that ever God made to us and our poſterity after us in his word: hence would follow in ſtead thereof, unthankfulneſſe and ſloathfulneſſe to inſtruct our children in godlineſſe; for what encouragement have we more then this, to bring them up in the feare of God. when we conſider that even immediately from their birth the Lord taketh and acknowledgeth them for his Children. Oh then let us labour to ſee the bountifull goodneſſe of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and let us offer to him our children, who will give them a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that be in his family and houſhold of faith, yea he will make them members of his Church and heires of his everlaſting Kingdome. Then what heart can be ſo cruell to debar his litle Infants from the ordinance of baptiſme, which is the doore of entrance to all the mercies of God both here and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.28. For (ſaith <hi>Luke</hi>) <hi>all the people that heard him and the publicans juſtified God, being baptized with the baptiſme of</hi> John; <hi>But the Phariſees and Lawyers rejected the counſell of God againſt themſelves. being not baptized of him,</hi> Luke 7.29.30.</p>
