            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Secondly, the Romi≈øh Clergy or the Prelacy are enemies to civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who exempt them≈øelves from under their power, and not onely ≈øo, but they ≈øeek to take the power from the Magi≈øtrates to them≈øelves, and ≈øo to make them their va≈ø≈øalls: their cavills I have an≈øwered di≈øtinctly in this Booke.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Famili≈øts</hi> are enemies to civill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, who ≈øeek to overthrow the eternall Law of God, on which the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Law is built: now if the≈øe men take away the foundation whereon all our Lawes are built, what doe they el≈øe in this, but ≈øeeke to overthrow all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill government, that they may more freely ≈øatisfie their licentious affections?</p>

               <hi>Smith,</hi> ≈øome <hi>Iohn≈øon,</hi> ≈øome <hi>Robin≈øon,</hi> ≈øome <hi>Ain≈øworth,</hi> but they all da≈øh one again≈øt another, and all excommunicate them≈øelves from the Church of Chri≈øt: and, ≈øuith <hi>Pager,</hi> three or four hundred <hi>Browni≈øts</hi> have brought forth more A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtate Anabaptists and Arrians ≈øometimes in one yeare than ten thou≈øand members of the Reformed Dutch Church in <hi>Am≈øterdam</hi> hath done in ten years, though tempted by ≈øeducers as much as any others: of this he was an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witne≈ø≈øe, being then and there a member of the Cla≈ø≈øicall A≈ø≈øemblies; ≈øee his Epi≈øtle to the Arrow again≈øt the Browni≈øts. They deny that Magistrates ≈øhould have any hand in Religion, or the worke of Reformation: they affirme that Christian Princes and Magi≈øtrates have no more to doe in or about the Church than Heathen Princes: but here they intrench upon civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, denying <hi>Cae≈øar</hi> his due: thus they would have civill government le≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øened, or limited. The Popi≈øh Clergy, they would have civill power remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Magi≈øtrate to them≈øelves: prophane people would have it conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at, in re≈øpect of them≈øelves; and <hi>Antinomians</hi> ≈øeek the violation of it by accident, in ≈øeeking to make voyd the Morall Law of God. Yet my purpo≈øe in writing this book was not to meddle with any of the≈øe; but as they ≈øet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me in the pur≈øuit of tho≈øe grand enemies of civill government, which are that wicked generation of the <hi>Anabapti≈øts;</hi> the≈øe are they to whom I chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bend the whole drift of my di≈øputation, as being ab≈øolute enemies to the e≈ø≈øentiall being of civill government. It is neither conniving, nor limiting, nor removing that will ≈øerve their turnes, unle≈ø≈øe they have an utter extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: ≈øo then all the rest doe ≈øome way or other da≈øh again≈øt civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but the≈øe are profe≈ø≈øed enemies to it. Hence I conclude that none of the≈øe are the men whom I intend, when, J ≈øay, they are faithfull Chri≈øtians, and loyall ≈øubjects.</p>
            <p>Now J an≈øwer affirmatively, that tho≈øe faithfull Chri≈øtians and loyall ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are tho≈øe people that are faithfull to <hi>Luthers</hi> Prote≈øtation, and to <hi>Calvins</hi> Jn≈øtitution: the fir≈øt of the≈øe was the originall cau≈øe from whence the name of Prote≈øtants did fir≈øt ari≈øe: for when <hi>Luther</hi> did fir≈øt renounce that ≈øtrumpet of <hi>Rome,</hi> he cau≈øed them all that were with him to enter into a Prote≈øtation again≈øt all Popery, and popi≈øh Innovations; and all that took it were ever afters wards called Prote≈øtants: and we in this Kingdome have taken the very ≈øame Prote≈øtation again≈øt all Popery and popi≈øh Innovations; and I doubt not but we have many among≈øt us who will hazzard lives and ≈øtates and all they have, to maintaine that Protestation, and through Gods mercy will prove them≈øelves good Prote≈øtants.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be two main arguments to prove the lawfulne≈ø≈øe of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill government among≈øt Chri≈øtians.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Civill government is very nece≈ø≈øary, and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in many perticulars, ≈øuch as the≈øe; It is nece≈ø≈øary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the outward wor≈øhipping of God, and to defend the ≈øound Doctrine of Godline≈ø≈øe, and the ≈øtate of the Church; and to frame our life to the fellow≈øhip of men, and to fa≈øhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our manners to civill righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and to procure us into Friend≈øhip one with another, and to nouri≈øh common peace and quietne≈ø≈øe. Now while we are here we ≈øtand in need of ≈øuch helpes, ≈øo then the thought of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe Civill Government is outragious cruelty, for we ≈øtand in as much need of it as of our bread and water, the Sun and the ayre, yea the dignity of it is farre more excellent; for if there were no civill government, men could not live together the outragiou≈øne≈ø≈øe of mans nature would be ≈øo boundle≈ø≈øe: Againe, if it were not for civill government it were unpo≈ø≈øible to uphold the true Religion, for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wickedne≈ø≈øe would ≈øo abound, as Idolatry and Sacriledge again≈øt the name of God, and bla≈øphemies again≈øt his Truth, and all manner of ≈øin; <hi>For the man</hi> Micah <hi>had his hou≈øe of Gods; In tho≈øe daies there was no King in I≈ørael, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man did that which was right in his o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Now the civill government re≈øtraines all the≈øe outragious abhominations among the people, that common peace be not di≈øturbed, that every man may keep his own in ≈øafety, that men may u≈øe their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires together without hurt or danger, that hone≈øty and mode≈øty may be kept, and that among Chri≈øtians there may be a profe≈ø≈øion of religion, and that among men may be a man like civility; So then this Ordinance of policie is to defend the true religion which is contained in the Law of God, that it be not openly and ≈øacriled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giou≈øly broken and defiled.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond maine ground to prove the lawfulne≈ø≈øe of civill Government, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the honourable Titles that God is plea≈øed to put upon it when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends

            <p>This plainly declares that the government of all things in earth that is in the hand of Kings and other Rulers, is onely from the Providence and the holy Ordinance of God to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> it ≈øeemed good ≈øo to order the matters of men, fora≈ømuch as he is both pre≈øent and Pre≈øident among them, in making of Lawes, and in executing upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe in judgments: This al≈øo <hi>Paul</hi> affirms &amp; reacheth when he reckoneth Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments among the gifts of God, which being diver≈øly di≈øtributed according to the diver≈øity of grace, and ought to be imployed of the ≈øervants of Chri≈øt to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8.

Thirdly, another kind of Libertines are the Papi≈øts with their whole Religion, being open enemies to the grace of God, turning it into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonne≈ø≈øe and liberty of ≈øinning again≈øt him divers waies: Fir≈øt, God having of his grace given unto the Church a power of the keyes to open and ≈øhut Heaven, but their religion hath turned it into an in≈øtrument of prophanene≈ø≈øe, in ≈øetting up a new Prie≈øthood to ab≈øolve and forgive ≈øins, properly in offering a Sacrifice both for the quick and dead, and ≈øo aboli≈øhing the Sacrifice of Chri≈øt.

Thirdly, of horrible Covetou≈øne≈ø≈øe, by ≈øelling of pardons for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øands of years, by which Craft they have gotten the third part of the Revenews of Europe into their hands, which proveth plainly that they turne the grace of God into a liberty of ≈øinning again≈øt him.</p>
            <p>The fourth ≈øort of Libertines, are carnall and formall Prote≈øtants, who turne the coun≈øell of Gods election into wantonne≈ø≈øe, ≈øaying, if I be elected to ≈øalvation, I ≈øhall be ≈øaved, let me live how I will, but if I be not elected, I ≈øhall not be ≈øaved, lot me do what I can.</p>
            <p>Secondly they turne the mercy of God into wantonne≈ø≈øe, in ≈øaying God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, I will de≈øer my repentance, for at what time ≈øoever a ≈øinner repenteth, God wil put all his ≈øins out of his remembrance: Therefore they will not repent yet, ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what young Saints and old Devils, thus they ca≈øt away the timely acceptance of Gods mercy with a ≈øcornful reproach.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ≈øome under pretence of brotherly love ≈øpend all that they have in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonne≈ø≈øe, ryot, exce≈ø≈øe, gameing, and company keeping to the begge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fourthly, others under a pretence that the Jewi≈øh Sabboth is abbrogated by Chri≈øt, and now there is no di≈øtinction of times, hence they will keepe no Sabboth at all.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, ≈øome others ≈øay <hi>where ≈øin abounded, grace abounded much more,</hi> Rom. 5.20. Therefore ≈øay they, <hi>let us continue in ≈øin that grace may abound: But all the≈øe turne the grace of our God into wantonne≈ø≈øe, and therefore by the ju≈øt judgement of God for committing ≈øuch things are worthy of death, yet they not only do the ≈øame, but take plea≈øure in them that do them,</hi> R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes unto their hearers. They tell them that they ≈øhalbe able to ≈øatisfie the ju≈øtice
<pb facs="tcp:155189:8"/>of God for their ≈øins, yea, and to merit everla≈øting life, and not only ≈øo, but they ≈øhalbe able to do works of Supererogation, that is, they ≈øhalbe able to do more then the law of God requires of them, yea, for a little money they ≈øhall have a tolleration to break any of Gods Commandements, and to reject them at their plea≈øure, much like to the old Phari≈øees, when Gods law ≈øaid: <hi>He that cur≈øeth father or mother ≈øhall dye the death;</hi> but the≈øe men will ≈øay, although <hi>he honour not his father or his mother he ≈øhall be free,</hi> Mat 15.46. The≈øe <hi>Achans</hi> have a long time troubled our <hi>I≈ørael: They neither feare God nor regara man,</hi> Luke 18.4. They de≈øpi≈øe all government both of God and man, divine and humane.</p>
            <p>Divine government is the ab≈øolute power of God, whereby he makes lawes to bind the con≈øcience, and that under pain of life or death eternall; Now this is the power of the whole Trinity, but the admini≈øtration of it is committed to the ≈øonne, this divine law of God is de≈øpi≈øed by <hi>Libertines,</hi> or as now they are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and by Anabapti≈øts, Papi≈øts, and prophane Prote≈øtants, yet at this time I intend not to call them to an account for de≈øpi≈øing of that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone, as in it ≈øelfe, but there is another kind of government de≈øpi≈øed of the≈øe men, which is a humane government, for the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith: <hi>Submit your ≈øelves to every ordinance of man for the Lords ≈øake, whether it be to the King as ≈øupreame or unto governours ≈øent by them,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14. This is that government which is ≈øo much de≈øpi≈øed, e≈øpecially by the Anabapti≈øts, to them I chiefly bend the drift of my di≈øputation, yet not conniving or ≈øparing any other that ≈øhall da≈øh again≈øt it, or any way ≈øeem to undervalue it.</p>
            <p>This humane or civill government is a ≈øtate of ≈øuperiority con≈øi≈øting in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of commanding, and in the power of the ≈øword for the good of mankind, that it is a ≈øtate of ≈øuperiority appeareth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Let every ≈øoule be ≈øubject to the higher power.</hi> Again, it con≈øi≈øteth in a double power, 1. In commanding, that is, of making laws and edicts, calling and conventing, the ≈øecond power is that of the ≈øword, and it may be comprehended under the≈øce 4. heads, 1. In arre≈øting, 2. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øoning, 3. In putting to death, 4. In making warre in way of protection or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe.</p>
            <p>The rea≈øon why this power of the ≈øword is added, is this, to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the authority of the magi≈øtracy, and the authority of the mini≈øtry: Now this difference ≈øtandeth in 3. things. Fir≈øt, the magi≈øtracy hath a power in it ≈øelfe, whereby the civill Magi≈øtrate may command in his owne name, but the Mini≈øtry hath power only to pronounce what God commandeth, and in his name ≈øaying; <hi>Thus ≈øaith the Lord, none dur≈øt ever ≈øay from him≈øelfe, I ≈øay unto you, but Chri≈øt alone,</hi> Math. 5.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the authority of the civill Magi≈øtrate is in him≈øelfe, but the authority of the Mini≈øter is not in him≈øelfe, but in Chri≈øt, ≈øo then the civill Magi≈øtrate may command obedience to him≈øelfe, but the Mini≈øter commandeth it to God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the civill Magi≈øtrate hath power over the outward man, but the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter hath power only to coun≈øell, per≈øwade and exhort. So much of the difference
<pb facs="tcp:155189:8"/>between the Magi≈øtracy and the Mini≈øtry.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this power of the ≈øword is added to di≈øtingui≈øh the power of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtracy from all private power, as in Schooles and Families, which have a power of commanding, but not of the ≈øword.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, I adde for the common good of mankind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. He is the Mini≈øter of God to thee for good, or for thy wealth, that is in procuring the welfare of ≈øoule and body, which ≈øtandeth in two things, Fir≈øt, true Religion, Secondly, civill ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice, both which are by the magi≈øtracy maintained,</p>
            <p>Now here it may be demanded, how farre the power of civill government rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth. I an≈øwer, over all cau≈øes, things, and words of men, whether Civil, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øia≈øticall, over Temporall things. I know none that will make que≈øtion of it, but the Anabapti≈øts, who deny the very being of it, but it al≈øo reacheth to the cau≈øes of the Church, and this appeareth in that the Kings mu≈øt have the booke of the Law before them when they ≈øit upon the Throne of the Kingdome, and it mu≈øt be with them, and they mu≈øt read therein all the dayes of their lives, that they may learne <hi>to feare the Lord their God, and that they may keep all the words of this law, and do them, that their heart be not lifted up above their brethren,</hi> Deut. 17.18.19.20.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this we may ≈øee in many examples of holy Kings in Scripture, <hi>Io≈øiah kept the Pa≈ø≈øeover and commanded others to keep it,</hi> 2 Chron. 35.1.16. and K. <hi>A≈øa</hi> commanded <hi>Iudah to ≈øeek the Lord God of their fathers, and to doe the Law and the commandement, and he took away the Altars of the ≈øtrange Gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves,</hi> 2 Chr. 14.3.4. <hi>And</hi> Mana≈ø≈øeh <hi>repaired the Altar of the Lord, and ≈øacrificed thereon Peace-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and commanded</hi> Judah <hi>to ≈øerve the Lord,</hi> Chap. 33.16. <hi>And</hi> Jo≈øiah <hi>tooke away all the abhominations out of all the Countreys that pertained to the children of I≈ørael, and he made all that was pre≈øent to ≈øerve the Lord their God,</hi> Cha. 34.33. <hi>I≈ørael ≈øerved the Lord all the dayes of</hi> Jo≈øhuah, <hi>and all the dayes of the Elders that out-lived</hi> Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Here I need not to di≈øpute which of the≈øe is the be≈øt kind of government for a Chri≈øtian Common-wealth to be governed by. I ≈øuppo≈øe a populer government is the way to ≈øedition and to Civill wars, and mutinies in a Common-wealth, and Monarchiall would be a very heavy burden for a free Nation to beare, when <hi>Rehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> told them he would make their yoake heavy, and whip them with Scorpions, he almo≈øt lo≈øt all his Subjects. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.14. Then I conceive a Parliamentary way of government to be mo≈øt agreeable to Gods word, and mo≈øt comfortable &amp; beneficiall to all the people, when the three States are a≈ø≈øembled, the King entring a Covenant with the Lords and Commons, repre≈øenting the whole body of the land: <hi>Thus all the Elders of I≈ørael came to</hi> Hebron, <hi>and</hi> David <hi>made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them in</hi> Hebron <hi>before the Lord, and they annoynted</hi> David <hi>King over all I≈ørael,</hi> 1 Chro. 11.3. <hi>And when</hi> Joa≈øh <hi>was annoynted King, all the chiefe of the Fathers of</hi> I≈ørael <hi>came to</hi> Jeru≈øalem, <hi>and all the Congregation made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the King in the hou≈øe of God,</hi> 2 Chron. 23.2, 3.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut now ≈øtep out the Anabapti≈øts, who de≈øpi≈øe government, ≈øaying, all ≈øwearing is unlawfull; for ≈øay they, Chri≈øt ≈øaith, <hi>≈øwear not at all,</hi> Mat. 5.34. I an≈øwer, that is meant in our communication, which mu≈øt be <hi>Yea, yea, and nay, nay v</hi> 37. Again, God commands ≈øwearing as a part of his wor≈øhip, ≈øaying, <hi>Thou ≈øhalt feare the Lord thy God, and ≈øerve him, and ≈øhale ≈øweare by his name,</hi> Deuteron. 6.13. &amp; 10.20. Now Chri≈øt came to do the will of his Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.30. And not to contradict it as our Anabapti≈øts bla≈øphemou≈øly affirme, while they ≈øay, Chri≈øt here flatly forbids ≈øwearing, which was commanded by God as a part of his wor≈øhip: but ≈øee how the≈øe wicked people would make a breach of Unity in the very Trinity betweene God the Father, and God the Son; then wel may the≈øe bla≈øphemers make rents and divi≈øions in Kingdomes and Common wealths. Again, the Apo≈øtle is ≈øo far from denying the lawful u≈øe of ≈øwearing, that hee gives a ≈øufficient rea≈øon to prove the lawfulne≈ø≈øe of it in ≈øome ca≈øes for ≈øaith he <hi>men verily ≈øweare by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is the end of all ≈øtrife,</hi> Heb. 6.16. Again, we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples of them that have ≈øworn upon ≈øome occa≈øions, both out of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtament and out of the New, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.23.31.53. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.31. This may ≈øuffice to prove that ≈øwearing in ≈øome ca≈øes is lawfull.</p>
            <p>Now to know what an oath is, we ≈øhall ≈øee by the parts of it, which are two, Confe≈ø≈øion and Imprecation: Confe≈ø≈øion is threefold, though for the outward forme the words be few: Fir≈øt, a man confe≈ø≈øeth that which he ≈øweareth to be true
<pb facs="tcp:155189:11"/>in his con≈øcience. 2. That God is a witne≈ø≈øe not of his outward action and ≈øpeech, but al≈øo of his particular con≈øcience. 3. That God is an omnipotent Judge of all, and of him that ≈øweareth, and able to ju≈øtifie him if he ≈øweare truly, or otherwi≈øe to condemne him eternally if he ≈øweare fal≈øly, the≈øe things are confe≈ø≈øed by him that ≈øweareth.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond thing in an oath is Imprecation, which is a prayer to God for two things. 1. That God would be witne≈ø≈øe with him that ≈øweareth, to te≈øtifie that hee ≈øweareth truly, and according to his con≈øcience, ≈øo <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. <hi>I ≈øpeak the truth in Chri≈øt, I lye not, my con≈øcience bearing me witne≈ø≈øe in the holy Gho≈øt.</hi> 2. a man prayes that God would become a Judge to cur≈øe him with eternall wrath, if he ≈øweare fal≈øly, thus did <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. I call God to record upon my ≈øoule; and the forme of ≈øwearing in old time was the u≈øing of this imprecation, <hi>God doe ≈øo to me, and more al≈øo if I do not thus and thus,</hi> 2 Kings 6.31. Thus you ≈øee what an oath is: Now it may be demanded, when be the times, and in what ca≈øes we may lawfully ≈øweare, ≈øeeing we may not ≈øweare in our communication.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, a man may lawfully ≈øweare, when the Magi≈øtrate mini≈øtreth an oath unto a man upon a ju≈øt occa≈øion, for the Magi≈øtrate hath the power of God in this ca≈øe, and therefore when he ju≈øtly requires it of a man, then he may lawfully ≈øwear.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when a mans own calling generall or particular, nece≈ø≈øarily requires an oath, and that in foure ca≈øes, 1. When the taking of an oath ≈øerveth to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, procure, or win unto God any part of his glory, or to pre≈øerve the ≈øame from di≈øgrace, in this regard <hi>Paul</hi> moved with a godly zeale, u≈øed an oath for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Doctrine, that the Churches to whom he writ, might be e≈øtabli≈øhed in the truth, and ≈øo glorifie God the more.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when his oath ≈øerveth to maintain or further his own or others ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or pre≈øervation in ≈øoule or body, in this ca≈øe <hi>Paul</hi> calls God for a record unto his ≈øoule, that he came not to <hi>Corinth</hi> to ≈øpare them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. And <hi>David</hi> to further him≈øelfe in the way of ≈øalvation bound him≈øelf by an oath that he would keepe Gods Commandements, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.106.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when the oath ≈øerves to confirme and e≈øtabli≈øh peace and ≈øociety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween party and party, countrey and countrey, Kingdome and Kingdome: <hi>Thus did</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Abimilech <hi>≈øweare each to other,</hi> Gen. 21.23. <hi>And</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Laban, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.53. And by vertue hereof do Subjects binde them≈øelves by oath in Allegiance to their Princes, and ≈øouldiers to their Generalls.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, when a man by oath may free him≈øelfe, and can no otherwi≈øe from tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lo≈ø≈øes, or procure to him≈øelfe ≈øome temporall benefits which be of great weight and moment, then do men take an oath for confirmation to put an end to all ≈øtrife, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. <hi>For much ≈øtrife and contention ari≈øeth about worldly affairs,</hi> and in this regard, a man by oath may purge him≈øelfe lawfully from infamy and ≈ølander: in the≈øe four ca≈øes a man may lawfully ≈øwear, not only before the Magi≈øtrate, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo privately, ≈øo it be with due reverence and good con≈øcience, but in common talke or on light occa≈øions, a man cannot lawfully ≈øweare, either by great or ≈ømall oaths,
<pb facs="tcp:155189:11"/>for that it is to take the name of God in vaine.</p>
            <p>Secondly it may be demanded, how mu≈øt a man take an oath, when he is by a ju≈øt occa≈øion called to ≈øwear? I an≈øwer, there be three vertues or ingredients in an oath, which mu≈øt not be wanting, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt ≈øweare, the Lord liveth in truth, in judgment, and in righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, truth, and that re≈øpecteth 2. things, 1. The matter whereto we ≈øwear, for God may not be brought for a witne≈ø≈øe to a lye, 2. It mu≈øt be in truth, according to the mind of him that ≈øweareth without fraud or deceit, and with intent to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that truly which he promi≈øeth thereupon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we mu≈øt ≈øweare in righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, which al≈øo re≈øpecteth two things, fir≈øt the thing ≈øworn to, that mu≈øt be ju≈øt and lawfull, and according to Gods word: ≈øecondly, the con≈øcience of the ≈øweater, for a man mu≈øt not ≈øweare for a trifle, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the thing be true, but either by authority of the Magi≈øtrate, or upon ≈øome nece≈ø≈øary cau≈øe of his lawfull calling, and again≈øt this vertue do tho≈øe ≈øinne that ≈øweare u≈øually in their common talke, though the thing be true, for trifles and light matters are not a ju≈øt cau≈øe of an oath.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we ought to ≈øwear in judgement, that is, he that ≈øweareth rightly, ought to know the nature of an oath, and be able to judge of the matter before whom, and to whom,, and of time and place, and other circum≈øtances, and for his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, he that ≈øweareth, ought to ≈øee in his own con≈øcience that he is fit to take an oath, and thereby to wor≈øhip and glorifie God; for he that ≈øweareth aright, ought to have his heart ≈ømitten with feare and awe toward God, as in all other parts of his wor≈øhip, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.20. <hi>The feare of God and ≈øwearing are joyned together,</hi> &amp; therefore a prophane man that hath no feare of God in his heart, ought not to ≈øweare, this may ≈øuffice our Anabapti≈øts concerning the lawfull u≈øe of ≈øwearing, e≈øpecially that oath of Allegiance to Princes, wherein they are bound in ≈øubjection to Civill government which they de≈øpi≈øe, and ≈øo much for their fir≈øt objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the lawfull u≈øe of Civill government.</p>
            <p>Their ≈øecond objection, they ≈øay that ≈øubjection came in with ≈øin, but (≈øay they) Chri≈øt hath taken away ≈øin, and therefore he hath taken away ≈øubjection al≈øo: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, they ≈øay that man in innocency was to <hi>rule over the fi≈øh in the ≈øea, the fowels of heaven, and over the bea≈øts on the earth, and all creeping things,</hi> but not over man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. But after the fall <hi>Eve</hi> is put under ≈øubjection to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. To this I an≈øwer, that there be two kinds of ≈øubjection, the fir≈øt is ≈øervile, the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond civill; the former is the ≈øubjection of a ≈ølave or va≈ø≈øal, who is onely to ≈øeeke the proper good of his Lord and Ma≈øter, the latter is that whereby one man is ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to another for the common good, the fir≈øt of the≈øe came in by ≈øin, but the ≈øecond was before ≈øin, even in innocency, and ≈øo <hi>Eve</hi> was ≈øubject to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency; and the Apo≈øtle argueth thus, <hi>Let the woman be ≈øubject to the man, for ≈øhee was taken out of man; for the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.8.9. <hi>Let the woman learn in ≈øilence with all ≈øubjection; I ≈øuffer not a woman to u≈øurpe
<pb facs="tcp:155189:12"/>authority over the man, for</hi> Adam <hi>was fir≈øt formed</hi> then <hi>Eve,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.11.12, 13. Now this was in their innocency that the woman was taken out of man, &amp; that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had the priority in creation, <hi>&amp; woman was made a help meet for man,</hi> Ge. 218. Therfore ≈øhe was ≈øubject in the time of innocency: Again, in the time of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it was ≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>d, <hi>increa≈øe and multiply,</hi> therfore by the light of nature there is a plain di≈øtinction between the father and the ≈øonne, the one to rule, the other to obey, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obedience is due to Magi≈øtrates: Again, they mi≈ø-alledg that place <hi>Gen</hi> 1.26, becau≈øe it was ≈øpoken not of man alone, but of all mankind, which comprehends a≈øwell women as men, for all mankind without exception had dominion over the ve≈øt of unrea≈øonable creatures; and for the ≈øecond place <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>He ≈øhal rule, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>d thou ≈øhalt be ≈øubject;</hi> this is not ≈øpoken as if ruling &amp; ≈øubjection were not before the fall, but becau≈øe now ≈øubjection is joyned with feare, griefe and ≈øorrow, this is that cur≈øe that came in by ≈øin, and was not in innocency, for then ≈øubjection was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull and full of plea≈øure; So then ≈øubjection it ≈øelfe is not a cur≈øe, but as feare, and griefe and ≈øorrow are joyned with it; then let us make our ≈øubjection to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrates a plea≈øure, and ≈øo the cur≈øe is taken off, and we ≈øhall enjoy the ble≈ø≈øing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 6.2.3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly they object, that every beleever is in the Kingdome of Heaven even in this life; and further, they ≈øay in Heaven there is no King but God, therfore belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are to be ≈øubject to none but God and Chri≈øt: I an≈øwer, there be two kinds of Government upon earth, one is ≈øpirituall and inward, this is called the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven that is within you, which ≈øtandeth in <hi>righte usne≈ø≈øe, peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, and joy in the holy Gho≈øt,</hi> Rom. 14.17. In regard of this government of Chri≈øt there is no difference, of bond and free, Ma≈øter and Servant, Father and Sonne, <hi>for all are one in Chri≈øt,</hi> Gal. 3.28. But the other is actuall Government, wherein orders and di≈øtinctions of men mu≈øt be maintained, as ≈øome mu≈øt be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ≈øome mu≈øt be Subjects, ≈øome Fathers, ≈øome children, ≈øome Ma≈øters, ≈øome ≈øervants: hence every man ought to ≈øu≈øtaine two per≈øons, and is to be con≈øidered fir≈øt as a believer, and a member of the Kingdome of Chri≈øt thus he is equall to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beleever, and any beleever is equall to him. Secondly, he mu≈øt be con≈øidered as a member of the Common-wealth wherein he liveth, thus he is either a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or an Inferiour, ≈øo then their rea≈øon were to ≈øome purpo≈øe if every beleever were only in the Kingdome of Heaven but every one that liveth here is al≈øo a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ≈øome Common-wealth, ≈øo that he mu≈øt either be a Magi≈øtrate to rule others, or el≈øe hee mu≈øt be ≈øubject, and obedient to others whom the Lord hath appointed to rule them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they object that civill Government is full of cruelty, which having the ≈øword in their hand, they de≈øtroy the bodyes and ≈øoules of offenders in not giving them time of repentance, and therefore is intolerable among Chri≈øtians: I an≈øwer, <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and the <hi>Levites</hi> by Gods commandement flew 3000. of the I≈øraelites for wor≈øhipping the golden Calfe, and never gave them ≈øpace to repent. Secondly, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors that are not moved to repentance under the ≈øentence of pre≈øent death, there
<pb facs="tcp:155189:12"/>is little hope that ever they will repent although they had longer time allowed to them. Thirdly, Gods wi≈øedome and commandement mu≈øt take place of mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, but he commandeth that the malefactor ≈øhould dye, that thereby the evill may be taken away; then better it is that one ≈øhould be de≈øtroyed then unity; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that one be removed then a multitude by the contagion of his example ≈øhould be infected, therfore civill government is nece≈ø≈øary, and ought to be obeyed.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, they object many places of Scripture, ≈øuch as the≈øe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Stand fa≈øt in the liberty wherin Chri≈øt hath ≈øet you free,</hi> from this they plead that they are freed by Chri≈øt from all obedience to Magi≈øtrates: I an≈øwer, the liberty which Chri≈øt hath procured us, is liberty of con≈øcience, and freedome from the power of ≈øin, Satan, death, hell and condemnation and therfore ≈øpirituall, but not from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall or civill ≈øubjection.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, from <hi>Ram.</hi> 13.8. the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <hi>owe nothing to any man but love,</hi> therefore ≈øay they, no obedience or ≈øubjection: I an≈øwer, there be two kinds of debts, 1. a civil debt occa≈øioned by contract and bargaining between man and man, the ≈øecond is a debt to which we are all bound by Gods commandement, Law or Covenant; but this place is to be under≈øtood of the fir≈øt of the≈øe ≈øo far as lies in our power, but we are bound ≈øtill in ≈øubjection and obedience to the latter, and be≈øides in this word love is comprehended all manner of duty what≈øoever, therefore love is the fulfilling of the whole Law: For as love to God includes obedience, ≈øo doth love to man the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.26. Where Chri≈øt had demanded before <hi>of whom the Kings of the earth take tribute, whether of his owne Children or of ≈øtrangers, and</hi> Peter <hi>an≈øwered, of ≈øtrangers, to which Chri≈øt replied, then are the children free;</hi> From hence they would gather, that there is no ≈øubjection due to Magi≈øtrates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe Kings Sonnes are freed from paying Tribute: To this I an≈øwer, that Chri≈øt here ≈øpeaketh of him≈øelfe, who was by his birth the heire of the Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Jewes, and therefore by right was to pay none, neither did he but to avoid offence, but how doth this free othermen from their obecie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce to Magi≈øtrates?</p>
            <p>Eighthly, from the≈øe words of <hi>Paul, Yee are bought with a price, be yee not the ≈øervants of man</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23. I an≈øwer the Apo≈øtle here doth not free ≈øervants from their ≈øubjection and obedience to them that are their Ma≈øters, for (≈øaith he) <hi>Servants obey in all things your Ma≈øters according to the fle≈øh,</hi> Col. 3.22. But they mu≈øt not make them ab≈øolute Lords over their ≈øoules and Conciences, and the graces of Gods ≈øpirit in them, the≈øe are the things of God; Now, if our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience move us to obedience, it mu≈øt be from Gods commandement and not from mans <hi>for ye ≈øerve the Lord Chri≈øt therefore do it heartily;</hi> but mark how, <hi>as to the Lord, and not to men,</hi> Col. 3.23 24.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, they object from the≈øe words of Chri≈øt ≈øaving, <hi>The Kings of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles exerci≈øe Lord≈øhip over them and they that exerci≈øe authority are called benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors but ye ≈øhall not be ≈øo,</hi> Luke 22.25. But what of this, here was a ≈øtrife among the Di≈øciples which of them ≈øhould be accounted the greate≈øt, and Chri≈øt to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øe
<pb facs="tcp:155189:13"/>their ambition, told them that their mini≈øtery was not like to Kingdomes in which one man hath preheminence above the re≈øt; but how doth this place hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Magi≈øtrates of that ≈øubjection which is due unto them? It is cleare from hence, that although the mini≈øtry ≈øhould be equall, that one ≈øhould not exalt him≈øelfe above another, yet it ought to be ≈øo in Kingdomes, therefore civill Government is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable and lawfull.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, they object, that beleevers are governed by the ≈øpirit of God, and ≈øo are able to governe them≈øelves every way, and need not any government of man: I an≈øwer, it is one thing what we doe, and another thing what we ought to doe, we ought indeed ≈øo to live as not to need any governours, but we doe not live ≈øo, yea if beleevers could live ≈øo, yet were the rea≈øon nought, for the vi≈øible Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines as well bad as good, hypocrites as well as ≈øincere Chri≈øtians, and therefore the be≈øt Churches ≈øtand in need of Magi≈øtracy for the puni≈øhment of evill doers, &amp; for the prai≈øe of them that do well, yea the Church lying open to the malice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and wicked men, ≈øtandeth ever in need of Magi≈øtracy to protect it by force, or warre, or otherwi≈øe.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, they object that all Chri≈øtians by the law of God are forbidden to kill, and ≈øaith the Lord, ≈øpeaking of the≈øe times under the Go≈øpell, <hi>that they ≈øhall not hurt nor de≈øtroy in all my holy mountaines,</hi> I≈øa 11.9. I an≈øwer, Magi≈øtrates in executing ju≈øtice, do not do it of them≈øelves, but as they are Deputies to the Lord, they do but execute his will; <hi>Ieho≈øaphat</hi> ≈øaid to the Judges, <hi>take heed what you do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 19.6. Then they doing all things by Gods authority, <hi>they ought not to beare the ≈øword in vaine,</hi> Rom. 13.4. Therefore <hi>David</hi> rehear≈øeth this among the vertues of a King: <hi>To cut off the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the Land, and all the workes of iniquity from the Citie of the Lord,</hi> P≈øal. 101. This made <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to forget his meekne≈ø≈øe, and <hi>David</hi> his gentlene≈ø≈øe, to doe the ju≈øtice of the Lord: The King that ≈øitteth on the throne of judgement, ≈øprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his eyes over every evill man. Again, <hi>a wi≈øe King ≈øcattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them</hi> Pro. 20.8.26. <hi>Take away the wicked from before the Throne, and the Throne ≈øhal be e≈øtabli≈øhed in righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe: An evill man ≈øeeketh only rebellion, therefore a cruel me≈ø≈øenger ≈øhalbe ≈øent again≈øt him,</hi> Pro. 16.12.17.11. Thus you ≈øee that magi≈øtrates may cut off malefactors by death, and yet be free from ≈øpilling blood, or the breach of that Commandement, which ≈øaith, <hi>Thou ≈øhalt not kill:</hi> Nay, it is their righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe to cut off the guilty malefactor, and by ≈øo doing, they do keep their own hands pure from the blood that tho≈øe murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers have ≈øhed, and on the contrary if they do not, they are guilty of mo≈øt horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wickedne≈ø≈øe, yet a Magi≈øtrate mu≈øt take heed that hee doth neither with rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou≈øne≈ø≈øe of mind wound them that he ≈øhould heale, nor with a ≈øuper≈øtitious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of clemency, fall into mo≈øt cruell gentlene≈ø≈øe.</p>

Then wars ≈øhall cea≈øe when there ≈øhalbe none in that Kingdome that offends, but the≈øe offenders mu≈øt be in the Church, till the very judgement day at the end of the world: The Angels which are the Reapers, ≈øhall take out tho≈øe tares that did offend, and ca≈øt them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell fire; then ≈øhall the ≈øecond <hi>Adam</hi> re≈øtore to the Saints all the creatures in their fir≈øt perfection, after that they are purified by fire, at that day the Saints ≈øhall inherit all things, and not before: For the fir≈øt <hi>Adam</hi> by ≈øin brought vanity and corruption upon all the creatures, but at that day the creatures ≈øhalbe purified and purged from their vanity and corruption, and then re≈øtored to the Saints alone, &amp; ≈øo they ≈øhall remain for ever; for the Second <hi>Adam</hi> wil re≈øtore againe to the Saints all that they lo≈øt, and not as they are now corrupted &amp; cloathed with vanity: <hi>For the new heavens and the new earth which I will make, ≈øhall remain before me, ≈øaith the Lord,</hi> I≈øa 66.22. <hi>Of that Kingdome there ≈øhalbe no end,</hi> Luke 1.33.

            <p>Here it may be demanded by what rule Civill Government is to be regulated: I an≈øwer, by the Civill and po≈øitive Lawes of that Kingdome from which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their authority and dignity of civill Magi≈øtrates, the≈øe Lawes are as ≈øtrong ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of Common-weales, or as <hi>Cicero</hi> calleth them, the ≈øoules, without which the Magi≈øtrate cannot ≈øtand, neither have they without the Magi≈øtrate any force, for the Law may be called a dumb Judge, and the Magi≈øtrate a living Law.</p>
            <p>Now the Jewes had three ≈øorts of Lawes, the Ceremoniall, which was to them a darke Go≈øpell, ≈øhewing forth Chri≈øt to them in darke Types and ≈øhadows, but ble≈ø≈øed be God, the vaile is taken away to us, and Chri≈øt is more clearly ≈øet forth to us ≈øince the publication of the Go≈øpell, and Chri≈øt is come, the ≈øub≈øtance of all tho≈øe dark Types and ≈øhadowes. Secondly, they had the Judiciall Law, which was the civill or po≈øitive Law of their Common-wealth; ≈øo an≈øwerable to this, wee have our po≈øitive Lawes of this Kingdome. Thirdly, they had the eternall Morall Law of God, which commandeth ≈øimply without guile to wor≈øhip God with pure faith and godly life. Secondly, it commandeth to imbrace man with unfained love, it is the true and eternall rule of all righteous walking both to God and men, and it is pre≈øcribed to men of all ages and times who are willing to frame their lives to the will of God, for this is his eternall and unchangeable will, that he him≈øelfe ≈øhould
<pb facs="tcp:155189:15"/>be wor≈øhipped of us all, and that we ≈øhould mutually love one another; So then although the judiciall or po≈øitive Lawes of the Jewes be taken away, yet the perpetuall duties of the Morall Law abide for ever.</p>
            <p>Hence I gather, that every Nation hath that liberty left them to make ≈øuch Lawes as they ≈øhall fore≈øee to be mo≈øt profitable for them, but they mu≈øt be framed after the perpetuall rule of charity, they mu≈øt be grounded upon the ≈øame foundation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may differ in the form-from other Nations: Now the Law of God which we call morall, is nothing el≈øe but a te≈øtimony of the naturall Law that was written in the heart of man by creation, &amp; ≈øome reliques of it are ≈øtill remaining in man, this morall law mu≈øt be the marke, and end, and rule of all Lawes; then what≈øoever lawes ≈øhall be framed according to that rule, and directed to that mark, and limited to that end, there is no cau≈øe why we ≈øhould di≈øallow them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they differ from the Jewi≈øh Law, or one Kingdome from another in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtration of it: as for example; the law of God forbiddeth ≈øtealing, now the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialty of theft is ≈øet downe in the civill lawes of the Jewes, to <hi>re≈øtore five oxen for an oxe and foure ≈øheep for a ≈øheep,</hi> Exod. 22.1.

               <p>Secondly, but they object that <hi>Vzziah</hi> the King burnt Incen≈øe upon the altar of Incen≈øe: <hi>Then</hi> Azariah <hi>the Prie≈øt went in after him, and four≈øcore Prie≈øts of the Lord that were valiant men, and they with≈øtood</hi> Uzziah <hi>the King, and</hi> Azariah <hi>the chiefe Prie≈øt, and all the Prie≈øts looked upon him, and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thru≈øt him out from thence,</hi> 2 Chron. 26.17, 18.20. Here ≈øay they, the Prie≈øt depo≈øed the King, and thru≈øt him out of the Temple: I an≈øwer, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zariah</hi> re≈øi≈øted the King not by force or violence, but by word only and admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby they cau≈øed him to depart out of the Temple; for it is ≈øaid, that hee him≈øelfe ha≈øted to go out, ver≈ø. 20. Neither was he depo≈øed from his government, but being by God ≈øtricken ≈øodainly with a lepro≈øie, he was by the law ≈øhut out from the company and ≈øociety of men, and ≈øo di≈øabled to govern, although the right of it ≈øtill belonged unto him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they object that example of <hi>Iehojada</hi> the high Prie≈øt who depo≈øed Qu: <hi>Athaliah</hi> from her Kingdome, and ≈øet up young <hi>Ioa≈øh</hi> to be King, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. Hence they conclude that the Pope hath authority to depo≈øe Kings and Emperours: I an≈øwer, <hi>Iehojadah</hi> the high Prie≈øt was next to the King in blood, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.11. And was one of the States of the Land, who depo≈øed her not alone by him≈øelfe, but by the common con≈øent of all the States and Peeres of the Land, ≈øee <hi>Chap.</hi> 23.1, 2. He indeed is chiefly named, becau≈øe he was the chiefe of them in blood; neither did he ≈øet up <hi>Ioa≈øh,</hi> but helped to maintain his right which was u≈øurped by <hi>Athaliah:</hi> in a word, he protected the right heire, but could not him≈øelfe depo≈øe nor make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Kingdome unto him; hence I conclude, that to exempt the Clergie from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the authority of the Civill Magi≈øtrate is rebellion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they object that Kings and Princes of their bounty have granted the≈øe priviledges unto them. I an≈øwer, the law of nature acknowledgeth a civill ≈øubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the law of God ≈øtraightly commands it, ≈øaying: <hi>Let every ≈øoule be ≈øubject to the higher powers,</hi> Rom. 13. And put them in mind to be ≈øubject to principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and powers, to obey Magi≈øtrates, and to be ready to every good worke, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.1. Then I conclude hence, that no law of any man may offer violence, or dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from either of the≈øe.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, they object from <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.10. where the Lord ≈øaith, <hi>I have ≈øet thee over Nations and Kingdomes, to plant and to pluck up:</hi> Hence they gather, that the Prophets and their Succe≈ø≈øors are not to be ≈øubject unto civill Government: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, the Prophet is ≈øet over Nations and Kingdomes, but not to governe by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill ≈øword, but by the ≈øword of the ≈øpirit in his mouth, and he is to plant and pluck up Kingdomes no otherwi≈øe then by declaring that God would plant, or pluck them up.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, they object from <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 60.10. <hi>That Kings ≈øhall come and ≈øerve the Church under the new Te≈øtament,</hi> and therefore the Church is not to be ≈øubject to Princes, but they unto the Church: I an≈øwer, in the Church are two things, fir≈øt, the per≈øons of men, ≈øecondly, the things of God: Now it is true that Kings are
<pb facs="tcp:155189:17"/>≈øubject to the things of God in the Church, as the word and Sacraments, to the≈øe Ordinances of God no calling is exempted, ≈øaith <hi>Paul, our ≈øelves are ≈øervants for Ie≈øus ≈øake;</hi> But to the fir≈øt of the≈øe, which is, the per≈øons of believers, to the≈øe, Kings and Magi≈øtrates are not ≈øubject; but to this very que≈øtion, when ≈øome ≈øervants were converted, when they lived under Infidell Ma≈øters, they thought them≈øelves by this ≈øpiritual calling to be freed from ≈øerving their Ma≈øters any longer, but (≈øaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>Let every man abide in the ≈øame calling wherin he was called; art thou called to the ≈øtate of grace being a ≈øervant? care not for it, yet if thou coulde≈øt be freed from ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Infidel, u≈øe it rather; but if thou can≈øt not, here is thy comfort, he that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, being a ≈øervant, is the Lords free-man, therfore brethren let every man wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is called, therein abide with God,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.20.21.22.24. So a ≈øubject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called, is not freed of his obedience to Civill Government, although he were effectually called under Infidel Governours: it is in this ca≈øe, as it is with outward riches, the people of God onely have a true right to them all by Chri≈øt, ≈øo that all the riches in the world is theirs, <hi>all is yours, and ye are Chri≈øts,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.21. And what others have, they are but u≈øurpers, yet beleevers mu≈øt not pre≈øently goe and take the≈øe outward things from any man, although he be never ≈øo wicked; So it is with places of Ma≈øters or Magi≈øtrates, although never ≈øo wicked, yet while they are in it, we ought to yeild obedience to them, for (≈øaith <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>Cervants be ≈øubject to your Ma≈øters with all feare,</hi> (now marke) <hi>not onely to the good and gentle, but al≈øo to the froward,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.18.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, they object that Kings and Magi≈øtrates are as ≈øheep, and Mini≈øters are as Pa≈øtors and Shepherds, therefore ≈øay they, Kings are under Mini≈øters, as the flock is under the Shepherd: I an≈øwer, in the Prophets or Pa≈øtors con≈øider two things; fir≈øt their per≈øons, ≈øecondly their Mini≈øtery; now in regard of their per≈øons all of them are ≈øubject to their Princes, and that for con≈øcience ≈øake, but in regard of their Mini≈øtry, Princes and Magi≈øtrates are to be ≈øubject, both when the Word is taught &amp; the Sacraments be admini≈øtred, all mu≈øt ≈øubmit them≈øelves unto it; even as a mean man being a Serjeant, may arre≈øt a Baron, Earle or Duke, neither may they re≈øi≈øt him, becau≈øe he commeth with the Princes authority to which he mu≈øt yeild him≈øelfe, though not unto the per≈øon of the Serjeant; So mu≈øt Magi≈øtrates ≈øubmit unto Mini≈øters, comming not in their owne name, but in the name of God and Chri≈øt; now this mu≈øt be marked, that Magi≈øtrates are not ≈øimply ≈øubject to the Mini≈øtry, but ≈øo far as they teach the word truly, and rightly admini≈øter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the which if they doe not, they have power to reforme or depo≈øe ≈øuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters as ≈øhall faile in their admini≈øtration, and in this regard Magi≈øtrates are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Shepherds, <hi>The Lord ≈øaith,</hi> Cyrus <hi>is my ≈øhepherd,</hi> I≈øa. 44.28. Though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe he be a ≈øheep, ≈øo far as he is truly taught by the Mini≈øter, <hi>For they may ≈øay to the King and to the Queeno, humble your ≈øelves,</hi> Jer. 14.18. <hi>And</hi> Herod <hi>feared</hi> John, <hi>and did many things, and heard him gladly,</hi> Mark 6.20. Thus we ≈øee that all men are to ≈øubmit them≈øelves to the Magi≈øtracy or Civil Government, and to the po≈øitive Lawes of the Land.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:155189:17"/>
               <p> Now the Romi≈øh Clergy are not enemies to Civil Government, as it is govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but as it is in the hand of Civil Magi≈øtrates, ≈øo that their drift is not to put it downe, but to remove it from the Magi≈øtrates to them≈øelves, that they might make all Magi≈øtrates their va≈ø≈øals.

<pb facs="tcp:155189:18"/>from whence the name of Prote≈øtants did fir≈øt ari≈øe, for when <hi>Luther</hi> did fir≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that ≈øtrumpet of <hi>Rome,</hi> he cau≈øed them all that were with him to enter into a Prote≈øtation again≈øt all Popery and popi≈øh Innovations, and tho≈øe that took that prote≈øtation were ever afterwards called Prote≈øtants, &amp; we in this Kingdome have of late taken the very ≈øame Prote≈øtation again≈øt all Popery and popi≈øh Innovations, therefore I doubt not but we have many among≈øt us, who will hazard lives and States and all they have to maintain that prote≈øtation, and ≈øo by the good ble≈ø≈øing of the Lord will prove them≈øelves good and faithfull Prote≈øtants: But for the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, although I call it <hi>Calvin's</hi> In≈øtitutions, yet not as if he had made it of his owne head, but as a faithfull ≈øervant of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he hath faithfully declared all the Coun≈øell of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.27. to all his fellow-brethren, that all may ≈øee what a Church Chri≈øt hath in≈øtituted in his word.</p>
               <p>Al≈øo this doth well agree with our late ≈øolemne Nationall Covenant, in which we have bound our ≈øelves, with our hands lifted up to the mo≈øt high God, ≈øwearing thus; That we ≈øhall ≈øincerely, really and con≈øtantly through the grace of God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in our ≈øeverall places and callings, the pre≈øervation of the reformed Church of Scotland, in Doctrine, Wor≈øhip, Di≈øcipline and Government again≈øt our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemies. Now I hope all tho≈øe that have thus engaged them≈øelves, are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that their doctrine, wor≈øhip, di≈øcipline and government are agreeable to Gods Word, el≈øe why have we bound our ≈øelves to pre≈øerve it there, and to acknowledge the enemies of it to be our common enemies, yet I deny not, but as it is there, it may have ≈øome failings which may admit of reformation: The Lord open our reformers eyes that they may connive at nothing that may prejudice the honour of Chri≈øt, or the good of his Church, but what≈øoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.23.</p>
               <p>Againe, wee have ≈øworne to endeavour the reformation of religion in England, Scotland, and Ireland, in doctrine, wor≈øhip, di≈øcipline and government according to Gods Word, and the be≈øt reformed Churches, and for this I hope we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that the Presbyteriall is the be≈øt reformation, el≈øe why do we bind our ≈øelves to pre≈øerve it in Scotland? we are or ≈øhould be re≈øolved be re≈øolved before we vow, and not after vowes to make enquiry, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.25.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, the Magi≈øtrate cannot determine que≈øtions of faith, nor know what order and decency in circum≈øtances is fitte≈øt for each Congregation, neither can he excommunicate offenders, for when the Prelates exerci≈øed Eccle≈øia≈øticall Juri≈ødicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and civil al≈øo, they did wrong both to the Prince; and al≈øo to the Presbitery.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, when Presbiters are e≈øtabli≈øhed in their full power, there remaines much power to the Prince even in things Eccle≈øia≈øticall, as to take diligent heed to the whole State of the Church within his Dominions, to indict Synods, and civilly to proceed in the ≈øame, to ratifie the con≈øtitutions thereof, to adde unto them the ≈øtrength of a civil power, to puni≈øh heretiques, and all that di≈øobey the a≈ø≈øemblies of the Church, to ≈øee that no matter Eccle≈øia≈øticall be carried factiou≈øly or ra≈øhly, but that ≈øuch things be determined in free a≈ø≈øemblies, to provide for Schollars, Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Churches, that all corrupt wayes of entring into the mini≈øtery, by Simony, bribing or otherwi≈øe, be repre≈øted; and la≈øtly, to compel all men to doe their duty according to the word of God, and the lawes of the Church.

               <p>But ≈øuppo≈øe they ≈øhould ≈øeek to comply with our independant people, and tell them that the King will grant them a free toleration if they wiladhere to him to oppo≈øe Presbiteriall government.

               <p>But what if the independant people them≈øelves ≈øhall take upon them to examine the Presbiteriall government, and pre≈øent their examination to the King and both Hou≈øes of Parliament, and tell them boldly, that all learned men have granted that the Churches con≈øtituted by the Apo≈øtles were all independant bodies but the man cannot produce any of the≈øe learned men, and therefore the ca≈øe is doubtfull, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides it were a hard ca≈øe if neither Scotland, France, Holland; and many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the Presbiteriall government is, or hath been, could not yeeld a learned man, this man I ≈øuppo≈øe to be either a Cobler or a Button-maker, or ≈øome ≈øuch prime Scholler, and yet be takes upon him to examine the learning of all the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches; but wil you be plea≈øed to ≈øee his learned expo≈øition of ≈øome texes of Scripture, ≈øuch as the≈øe? <hi>The Kingdome of God is at hand,</hi> that is ≈øaith he, <hi>a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation is at hand,</hi> Math. 3.2. <hi>And to be fellow Citizens with the Saints and of the hou≈øhold of God,</hi> this ≈øaith he, is meant of a paiticular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 2.19. <hi>And for the Queen to ≈øtand on the right hand of Chri≈øt in gold of Ophir,</hi> this ≈øaith he al≈øo is a particular congregation, <hi>P≈øalm.</hi> 45.9.

               <p>But further he ≈øaith in that examination, that the Pope is Antichri≈øt becau≈øe hee will have men to appeale from other Churches to him, and to ≈øtand to his ≈øentence and decree; but ≈øaith he, doe not Presbiter: all A≈ø≈øemblies and Synods take upon them the ≈øame authority?</p>
               <p>I an≈øwer, no, they differ thus: Fir≈øt, the Pope is one and receiveth appellations Monarchically, but Synods con≈øi≈øt of many, and receive appellations ari≈øtecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly. 2. The Pope receiveth appellations from other Nations beyond Sea, but Presbiteries and Synods do not ≈øo. 3. The Pope will have his ≈øentence received as

               <p>But now give me leave, being thus ≈øet upon by the independant men, to lay open ≈øome of their errours, to ≈øee how they will ≈øtand in a well ordered Church.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, independant Churches hold them≈øelves to be all Rulers, and none to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: which is again≈øt all ≈øence, rea≈øon, and Scripture al≈øo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7.27.1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. But they are ≈øomething a≈øhamed that they have none to rule, therefore they would make their ruling Elders them≈øelves be their ≈øervants; and yet to hold ≈øtill the name of rulers, which is as bad an errour as the former, for although ruling Elders mu≈øt not be as Lords to the Church, neither mu≈øt the Church be as Lords over them, and while they claime this authority for their Church, they do but ≈øeeke to remove the Prelates Lord≈øhip to their independant Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

<pb facs="tcp:155189:21"/>committed to try them there. But this their folly needs no confutation, and ≈øaith <hi>Paul</hi> concerning Church cen≈øures, I heare <hi>that there is fornication committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you,</hi> (now marke) <hi>For I verily as ab≈øent in body, but pre≈øent in ≈øpirit, have judged and determined already concerning him that hath ≈øo done, and that was to deliver ≈øuch a one to Sathan for the de≈øtruction of the fle≈øh, that the ≈øpirit may be ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the day of the Lord Ie≈øus:</hi> Yet it was not fully done without the con≈øent of the whole Congregation, although judged and determined in their ab≈øence; <hi>Yet it was executed when they were gathered together,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.3, 4, 5.

And <hi>Solomon</hi> joyntly together commands us <hi>to feare God and the King,</hi> Pro. 24.21. So then <hi>Peter</hi> would have us to have a high e≈øtimation of them, and <hi>Solomon</hi> joyning them together with God him≈øelfe, ≈øheweth that holy reverence and dignity that is put upon them; <hi>Then cur≈øed bee tho≈øe filthy dreamers that de≈øpi≈øe dommion, and ≈øpeake evill of dignities,</hi> Jude 8. And ≈øaith <hi>Paul ye mu≈øt needs be ≈øubject for con≈øcience ≈øake,</hi> Rom. 13.5. That is, he would have us free in our obedience to them, without ≈ølavi≈øh feare of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, becau≈øe what is done to them is done to God, yet this honourable calling can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not excu≈øe the ≈øins that cleave unto them that are in ≈øuch places; but the calling it ≈øelfe is worthy of honour and reverence; then who≈øoever be rulers mu≈øt be e≈øtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with us, and have reverence in re≈øpect of their being rulers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we mu≈øt not only honour them in our minds, but this mu≈øt be te≈øtified by our practi≈øe, in obeying their lawfull proclamations, and in paying tribute, and in taking publique office and charges upon us, that may ≈øerve for common defence, or any other lawfull commands; <hi>For he that re≈øi≈øteth, re≈øi≈øtoth the ordinance of God, therefore be ≈øubject:</hi> Rom. 13.1. Again, ≈øaith <hi>Paul, warne them that they be ≈øubject to Principalites and powers, to obey Magi≈øtrates, and ready to every good worke,</hi> Tytus 3.1.

<pb facs="tcp:155189:27"/>but I think no rationall man can like the ta≈øte of it: Againe, thou do≈øt not declare what it is that will offend thee, ≈øo that I ≈øuppo≈øe, if Chri≈øt him≈øelfe were here on earth, thou would≈øt be offended at him as ≈øome others were, <hi>for many were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at him, they e≈øteemed him as a rock of offence,</hi> Rom. 9.32.33.

               <p>Then doth Chri≈øt ≈øay, <hi>If my hand offend me, or if my foot offend me, I mu≈øt cut them off, and ca≈øt them from me;</hi> or el≈øe doth Chri≈øt ≈øay, both I all and my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers mu≈øt be ca≈øt into everla≈øting fire; and doth Chri≈øt ≈øay, if I doe not cut them off, I cannot enter into life? and doth Chri≈øt ≈øay, it is better for me that one of my members ≈øhould peri≈øh, then that I with all my my≈øticall body ≈øhould be ca≈øt into hell? neither doth he ≈øay, if my eye offend me, I mu≈øt pluck it out, nor ≈øay, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for me with one eye to enter into life, then to have two to be ca≈øt into hell fire; Let thy con≈øcience ≈øpeak, thou bla≈øphemer, and tell me whether it be ≈øo in thy book: neither is it ≈øaid, if a hand or foot in Chri≈øts body offend him, they mu≈øt be cut off; neither is it ≈øaid, that if the eye of Chri≈øt offend him, it mu≈øt be plucked out, or el≈øe the whole body of Chri≈øt ≈øhalbe ca≈øt into hel: Then hear the words of Chri≈øt; <hi>If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and ca≈øt it from thee: for it is profitable for thee, that one of thy members ≈øhould peri≈øh, and not that thy whole body ≈øhould be ca≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell.</hi> And ≈øo, <hi>If thy hand offend thee, cut it off, and ca≈øt it from thee, for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members ≈øhould peri≈øh, and not that thy whole body ≈øhould be ca≈øt into hell,</hi> Math. 5.29, 30. So then the meaning of the≈øe words is this: The members of our body naturall before conver≈øion, do nothing but act ≈øin; Now of nece≈ø≈øity that corruption mu≈øt be cut off from tho≈øe members: and rather then the corruption ≈øhould not be cut off, let that member peri≈øh, rather then it ≈øhould abide on thy body to act ≈øinne; <hi>What, are thy eyes ≈øo full of adultery that they cannot cea≈øe from ≈øinne?</hi> 2 Pet. 2.14. <hi>Can≈øt thou not looke on a woman, but thou mu≈øt lu≈øt after her? thou committe≈øt adultery in thy heart,</hi> (then ≈øaith Chri≈øt expre≈ø≈øely) <hi>plucke it cut, it is profitable for thee,</hi> Math. 5.28, 29. It were better tho≈øe eyes were out, then ≈øo to ≈øin again≈øt God: yet this mu≈øt not be done till wee have tryed all other meanes, and nothing will reforme this lu≈øting member, as we would do in the like ca≈øe with a tooth, that with paine much offends us: fir≈øt, we try if we can take away the paine and ≈øave the tooth, but when all means have bin u≈øed, and we cannot take a way the paine, we had better lo≈øe the tooth, then to be ≈øo offended with the paine of it. Now the evill of ≈øinne that is in the eye, ≈øhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us as much as the evill of puni≈øhment in the tooth, and we ≈øhould u≈øe all means to remove it, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, <hi>to make a Covenant with his eyes not to looke upon a maid,</hi> Job 31.1. That is, we ≈øhould bind our eyes with the cords of a Covenant from lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting, and we ≈øhould bind our feet from carrying us into temptations, ≈øee <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 5.7. And we ≈øhould keep our mouth as it were with a bridle, <hi>P≈øalm</hi> 39.1. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe our ≈øins are too ≈øtrong for us, <hi>we ≈øhould therefore pray the Lord to turne our
<pb facs="tcp:155189:28"/>eyes from beholding vanity</hi> P≈øalm. 119.37. Thus when all meanes are u≈øed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame our members from ≈øin and nothing will do it, thou had≈øt better plucke out thy eye, and cut off both hands and feet, then to employ them in the ≈øervice of the Divell to thy eternall ruine of body and ≈øoule.</p>
               <p>Againe, if wee ≈øhould lo≈øe a member here, we ≈øhould have it re≈øtored againe at the Re≈øurrection day, therefore that Bi≈øhop who had ≈øub≈øcribed with his hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt God, when the Lord opened his eyes to ≈øee what he had done, he ≈øuffered for the truth, and cau≈øed that hand to be burnt off, which had ≈øo offended both again≈øt God, and again≈øt him≈øelfe, yet I ≈øay againe, if it be po≈ø≈øible, we mu≈øt ≈øave the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; as <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>no man ever yet hated his owne fle≈øh,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 5.29. For we ≈øee if a man have got a hurt in his hand or foot, he will u≈øe all means that may be to heal it, to ≈øave his hand or foote; but when nothing will do it, he will rather cut it off, then endure the paine, and endanger his whole body: For if one part of the body be in paine, there is no part of the body free, ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>if thy eye be evill, thy whole body is full of darkne≈ø≈øe,</hi> Math. 6.23. That is, if the eye of the body be not good to ≈øee, the whole body is in danger in all places to be hurt: and ≈øo the eye of the ≈øoule which is the under≈øtanding, if that be not cleare, the ≈øoule is in danger to be ≈øplit on many rocks; but let us come to <hi>Nuts</hi> expo≈øition, which is this, if thine eye be evill, thy whole body is full of darkne≈ø≈øe: This eye ≈øaith he, is the Mini≈øter or the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the which if he be blind, all the Anabapti≈øts are blind al≈øo: and if he be evill, then the re≈øt cannot be good; he ≈øaid before, that if one member did offend, he mu≈øt be cut off, or el≈øe all the Anabapti≈øts mu≈øt peri≈øh in hell fire; and here he ≈øaith, if one be evill, all are ≈øo, if one be blinde, all are blinde: then I reply upon him thus, that if they be all alike, that if there be one bad, there is none good; then why ≈øhould another be ca≈øt into hell to ≈øave <hi>Nut,</hi> when he is as bad him≈øelfe; wel, Chri≈øt ≈øaith, if thy eye, thy hand and thy foot offend thee, do ≈øo and ≈øo; but ≈øaith <hi>Nut</hi> to Chri≈øt againe, if thy eye, or thy hand, or thy foot offend thee, do ≈øo and ≈øo: which ≈øhewes plainely to all men, that his eye is as blinde as a beetle, to di≈øcerne ≈øpirituall things.</p>
               <p>Again, how will <hi>Nut</hi> con≈øtrue this word, two eyes, two hands, and two feete in the my ≈øticall body of Chri≈øt, ≈øo that if one be cut off, there is but one remaining: and againe, which is the right eye and which is the left in the my ≈øticall body of Chri≈øt; I thinke all the braines that is in this <hi>Nut,</hi> knowes not how to give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer to the≈øe things: but ≈øuppo≈øe they have two teachers, whom they call their eyes, ≈øuppo≈øe one of the≈øe offend and be excommunicated, and the other dye in the mean time, and ≈øo leave them all ≈øtarke blind: <hi>And ≈øo the blind lead the blind till they all fall into the ditch:</hi> I hope they will not provide more eyes, then they have holes to put them in, ≈øo that when one is gone, to clap another into the hole; Thus we may ≈øee the folly of <hi>Nuts</hi> expo≈øition, who would ≈øee by another mans eyes, but we mu≈øt all appear before the judgement feate of Chri≈øt, and receive according to what is done in our owne body, &amp; not according to what was done in another mans body.</p>
               <p>Well thus you ≈øee that Chri≈øt here ≈øpeaketh of our naturall members, that in ca≈øe
<pb facs="tcp:155189:28"/>nothing will take off tho≈øe ≈øinfull corruptions that naturally cleave to them, tho≈øe naturall members had better be cut off in this life, then that the whole man ≈øhould peri≈øh eternally, ≈øo that neither politicall, nor my≈øticall members, but naturall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are meant in this place.</p>
               <p>But will <hi>Nut</hi> ≈øay it is a great ab≈øurdity, when the body is maimed, that the ≈øoule ≈øhould enter into life? In this he declares him≈øelfe to be as blinde as a beetle, for all the members at the re≈øurrection ≈øhalbe re≈øtored againe perfectly; but this man ≈øees with another mans eyes, and not with his owne: I may ≈øuppo≈øe this is the cau≈øe why they will not allow of wars under the Go≈øpell, le≈øt they ≈øhould lo≈øe a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ≈øo go lame to heaven.</p>
               <p>He makes another ab≈øurdity, ≈øaying, if tho≈øe corruptions that cleave to our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers offend us, then we mu≈øt cut them off, but if they do not offend us, we mu≈øt not cut them off, and we may enter into life with our corruptions, if ≈øo be they doe not offend us. I an≈øwer, men are of two ≈øorts; either in the ≈øtate of grace, or in the ≈øtate of nature; Now for tho≈øe in the ≈øtate of grace, who have a new life wrought in them, <hi>and they have given their members as ≈øervants to Chri≈øt,</hi> Rom. 6. It mu≈øt needs grieve them when tho≈øe members ≈øhall act any ≈øin, ≈øaith <hi>Paul, I keepe my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy under, and bring it in ≈øubjection,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. Yet ≈øaith he, <hi>this law of ≈øinne that is in my members, warreth again≈øt the law of my mind, and again≈øt his will, leads him into the law of ≈øin,</hi> Rom. 7.23. Yet when he cannot ≈øubdue tho≈øe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in his members, it appeares plainely that they did offend him, el≈øe what makes him cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ≈øhall deliver me?</hi> ver≈ø. 24. And although it be ≈øaid, if they do offend, yet t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Thus ≈øaith Chri≈øt, but what ≈øaith <hi>Nut?</hi> he flatly contradicts Chri≈øt, ≈øaying, the taking away of corruptions wounds the man, this is <hi>Nut's</hi> expo≈øition: Again, the text ≈øaith not that halt &amp; maimed ≈øhal enter into life <hi>Nut</hi> is much mi≈øtaken to think any ≈øuch ≈øhall be in heaven, there is nothing lacking that makes for the happine≈ø≈øe of the creature, <hi>there is fulne≈ø≈øe of joy,</hi> P≈øal. 16. which could not be if halt or blind were there: well then the words of Chri≈øt are as an an≈øwer to a que≈øtion that might be asked, whether is it better to enter into life wanting a member, or to be ca≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everla≈øting fire having all the members? Chri≈øt an≈øwereth, it is better to enter into life although we want a member: but will it follow hence that if a child of God ≈øhould lo≈øe a member here, that he mu≈øt needs enter ≈øo into heaven at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection. Other ab≈øurdities he would rai≈øe from that other tran≈ølation, <hi>If thy eye hand or foot cau≈øe thee to offend, pluck it out and cut them off, and ca≈øt them from thee;</hi> and if one lu≈øt cau≈øe thee to offend, cut that off, but keep ≈øtill that which doth not cau≈øe thee to offend; but the≈øe are meere cavils and an≈øwered ≈øufficiently alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. He would gather hence that ≈øome corruptions will offend, and ≈øome will not offend: to this I an≈øwered before, that all men have ≈øome corruptions, yet ≈øome men are dead in ≈øin and pa≈øt feeling, not capable to be offended, others have the life of grace in them, and if their members which are given to Chri≈øt ≈øhould be acting ≈øin, it mu≈øt needs offend them; then are thy naturall members imployed in ≈øinne again≈øt God, whether it be the eye to receive ≈øin to the heart from objects without, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be any other member to act it or to increa≈øe and improve it; then either that
<pb facs="tcp:155189:29"/>≈øinfull lu≈øt mu≈øt off, or el≈øe that member that acts it mu≈øt off, rather then to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Divels ≈øervice to ≈øin again≈øt God; and if <hi>Nut</hi> trample this under his feet as un≈øavoury ≈øalt, it declares plainely that he hath no reli≈øh as yet of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Nut</hi> moves a que≈øtion, ≈øaying, if this be the truth, that hands, feet and eyes be members mo≈øt eminent in Churches. how comes it to pa≈ø≈øe that this truth hath been kept ≈øecret ≈øo long? but here by <hi>Nut's</hi> good leave I que≈øtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a truth, and it ≈øeemes he concludes it to be a truth before he hath the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his neighbours, who would have coun≈øelled him better if he had told them that he had ≈øome carne≈øt bu≈øine≈ø≈øe with ≈øome of the eminent members of the body politick, they would have ≈øaid to him, doe not goe to the foot, &amp; why not to the foot? becau≈øe it is not one of the eminent members of the body politick, it is very likely ≈øome child might have convinced his folly; but then it may be he will reply and ≈øay, the foot is eminent in the my≈øticall body, but now turne to the place and ≈øee how God hath ≈øet the members in the body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 18. and there you ≈øhall ≈øee how he comforts weake chri≈øtians, ≈øaying to them, <hi>if the foot ≈øhall ≈øay, becau≈øe I am not the hand I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?</hi> ver≈ø. 15. Again, he ≈øpeakes to tho≈øe that are eminent, that they ≈øhould not de≈øpi≈øe the weake ones, ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>the eye cannot ≈øay to the hand, I have no need of thee, nor the head to the feet, I have no need of you,</hi> ver≈ø. 21. Thus you ≈øee the feet are not the eminent members of the Church, but rather in the meane≈øt place of all: now if this be ≈øo, how will <hi>Nut</hi> prove his truth (he ≈øaith) hath beene hid ≈øo long? here I will not proceed to his rotten an≈øwer, becau≈øe that will fall together with his rotten foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
               <p>Againe, he ≈øaith by the way, that Chri≈øt will allow of no members of his body, Kingdome or Church, but vi≈øible Di≈øciples: I an≈øwer with a demand of him, why they are called hidden ones, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 83.3. If they be hidden, they are not vi≈øible, and what is <hi>that white ≈øtone, and that new name written, which no man knoweth ≈øave he that hath it?</hi> Revel. 2.17. If no man ≈øee the writing of Gods ≈øpirit but them≈øelves, then ≈øure they are not all vi≈øible Saints; and why did not the Prophet know that ≈øeven thou≈øand that had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal?</hi> and why did not the Apo≈øtles know the traytor that was among≈øt them? Is <hi>Nut</hi> ≈øo eminent to ≈øee further into ≈øpiritual things then Prophets and Apo≈øtles? and yet I proved him but even now to be as blind as a beetle in ≈øpirituall things, but to the≈øe things I ≈øhall ≈øpeake more fully when I come to ≈øpeake concerning baptizing Infants.</p>
               <p>After this, he falls foule upon our Mini≈øters, ≈øaying, that none of our Univeri≈øity Mini≈øters are faithfull, and that God will reveale his mind to mechanick fooles and babes, rather then to learned Mini≈øters, and what he did to learned <hi>Paul,</hi> was but one example to ≈øhew his power; but he hath not promi≈øed to reveale his will to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more wi≈øe and learned.

But when revelation is wanting, being an extraordinary calling, then the Schooles of the Prophets remaine ≈øtill, being the ordinary meanes appointed by God to teach all tho≈øe that are to teach others; this manner of teaching hath beene from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. The Patriarchs till <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> were Prophets in their Families, not onely in a generall way, but in an e≈øprciall manner, they taught their fir≈øt borne that they might ≈øucceed as Prophets after them.

               <pb facs="tcp:155189:30"/>
               <p> The ≈øeeing teaching of them that are to be teachers is of ≈øuch antiquity, and to ≈øo good u≈øe in the Mini≈øtery, all men ≈øhould be exhorted to put to their helping hands that this thing may goe forward. Princes are to maintaine it by their bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulues &amp; authority, as they have done &amp; do ≈øtil they mu≈øt do it more, &amp; parents mu≈øt dedicate the fitte≈øt of their children to the ≈øervice of God in the Mini≈øtery, and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents rau≈øt love and affect this calling above all other; <hi>of all gifts de≈øire rather that ye may prophe≈øie,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.1. And la≈øtly, all men mu≈øt pray that God would pro≈øper and ble≈ø≈øe all Schooles of learning where this kind of teaching is in u≈øe, that the mini≈øtery may be furni≈øhed at the lea≈øt with the original tongues in which the Scripture was fir≈øt publi≈øhed; for although Chri≈øt che≈øe men into the mini≈øtery without learning, yet he furni≈øhed them in an extraordinary manner with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of al tongues &amp; languages, and although they were furni≈øhed with abundance of grace in their hearts before, yet he charged them to tarry at Jeru≈øalem untill they had this gift al≈øo, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. <hi>And on the day of Penteco≈øt the holy Gho≈øt came upon them, and they began to ≈øpeake with other tongues,</hi> Acts 2.1.4. But now no Mini≈øter can look to be ≈øurni≈øhed in this manner: they mu≈øt goe the ordinary way now in the Schools of the Prophets to attain to ≈øo much learning as they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive; this may ≈øuffice to ≈øatisfie any rationall man that our Univer≈øities are lawfull and warrantable, and that the Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpell ought to have the knowledge of the original tongues wherein the Scripture was fir≈øt written.</p>
               <p>Again, the calling of the Mini≈øters ought to be manife≈øt, both to their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences and al≈øo to their hearers, and that for divers rea≈øons; Fir≈øt they are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øadors, and, as it were, the mouth of God to the people; for this cau≈øe they are to ≈øpeake in the name of God, and this they cannot doe unle≈ø≈øe they know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, Secondly, the calling of the Mini≈øtery tends much to edification, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite that he ≈øhould have the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of Gods ≈øpirit in a large mea≈øure, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God on him and his Mini≈øtery, and al≈øo his hearers ≈øtand in need of the operation of Gods ≈øpirit in their hearts; but he that wants the a≈ø≈øurance of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cannot pray to God in faith for the≈øe things, neither can he apply the promi≈øes of God to him≈øelfe. Thirdly, the knowledge of their callings breeds con≈øcience of their duties, diligence and the feare of God. La≈øtly, the knowledge of their callings in the con≈øciences of their hearers breeds a reverence in their hearts, and obedience to the mini≈øtery of the word.</p>
               <p>Now here it may be demanded how they may know that they are called of God to the mini≈øtery of the word: I an≈øwer, they may know it if they find three things in them≈øelves; the fir≈øt is the Te≈øtimony of their con≈øciences, that they entred not for prai≈øe, honour or lucre, but in the feare of God, with a de≈øire to glorifie him, and to edi≈øie the Church. Secondly, a faculty to doe that which they have a de≈øire to doe; in this ≈øaculty are two things; 1. A knowledg of God and of his ways, 2. Aptne≈ø≈øe to deliver that which they know. The third thing whereby they may know their calling, is the ordination of the Church, which appeares and gives te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their will and abilitie; he that hath the≈øe things is certainly called of God:
<pb facs="tcp:155189:31"/>Now put the ca≈øe a man wants the fir≈øt of the≈øe three, and entred with an evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, being carried with ambitious and covetous de≈øires: I an≈øwer, yet his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ≈øtill in re≈øpect of the Church is good and lawfull, and when he repents of his bad con≈øcience, it is al≈øo accepted of God.</p>
               <p>So then Mini≈øters mu≈øt have a calling or el≈øe they cannot preach, for (≈øaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>how ≈øhall they preach except they be ≈øent.</hi> Rom. 10.14.15. <hi>No man ought to take that honour upon him≈øelfe, but he that is called of God as</hi> Aaron <hi>was,</hi> Heb. 5.4. <hi>Vzzah</hi> was ≈ømitten with death for but touching the Arke, although his intent was but to ≈øtay it from from falling. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.7. And the men of Beth≈øheme≈øh were ≈ølaine for but looking into the Arke without a calling, fifty thou≈øand, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19. therefore the Apo≈øtles in the front of their Epi≈øtles declare their calling. This might convince our phanta≈øtical Anabapti≈øts, who think that any man may preach that will, without any ≈øpeciall calling, and they alledge for their purpo≈øe, that <hi>the hou≈øe of</hi> Stephanus <hi>addicted them≈øelves to the mini≈øtery of the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.15. I an≈øwer, the meaning of the place is not that they called them≈øelves but that they ≈øet them≈øelves apart to the mini≈øtery of the Saints, in the purpo≈øe and re≈øoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their hearts, of all gifts they de≈øired to prophe≈øie: yet the≈øe de≈øires did not make them Mini≈øters except God were plea≈øed to furni≈øh them with gifts, and they ordained by the Church; but till then they mu≈øt give me leave to put it out of my beliefe that they were Mini≈øters. Again, they alledge that all Chri≈øtians are Kings and Prie≈øts, and the office of the Prie≈øt is to teach: I an≈øwer, we are ≈øpiritual Kings over our owne corruptions in this world; <hi>For grace reignes through righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, unto eternall life through Ie≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> Rom. 5.21. And in this world <hi>wee are a holy Prie≈øthood to offer up ≈øpiritual ≈øacrifices acceptable to God by Ie≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. <hi>But when iniquity ≈øhall have amend, and the Saints are freed from ≈øin,</hi> Rom. 6.7. <hi>they ≈øhall inherite all things,</hi> Revel. 21.7. In ≈øtead of reigning over their corruptions, they ≈øhall reigne over all the creatures when they are again re≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their fir≈øt perfection, as <hi>Adam</hi> did in his innocency, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. The ≈øecond <hi>Adam</hi> will re≈øtore them to us perfect againe at the day of judgement, being puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by fire at that day. <hi>For he hath made us Kings and Prie≈øts, and we ≈øhall reigne on the earth,</hi> Revel. 5.10. <hi>And being Prie≈øts, when the ≈øacrifice of player ≈øhall cea≈øe, being in full fruition, yet we ≈øhall offer the ≈øacrifice of prai≈øe to God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> Heb. 13.15. <hi>I heard a great voice of much peoole in Heaven, ≈øaying, Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah, ≈øalvation and glory and honour and power unto the Lord our God,</hi> Revel 19.1.

Chro. 27.16.18.19. But all might prophe≈øie or teach, ≈øo that they keep within their bounds and limits appointed them, that is, their owne Families. Fathers may teach their children, and Ma≈øters their ≈øervants, they may command to keep the Sabbath all within their gates; but we being ≈øpiritual Prie≈øts maketh nothing to prove that all may teach publiquely. Thirdly, they alledge that the power of the keyes is given to the Church: I an≈øwer, that it is ≈øo, yet the u≈øe and admini≈øtration thereof belongs to the Mini≈øters onely in their di≈øpen≈øation of the word; So then none are to meddle in the Mini≈øtery but they that have a lawfull calling thereunto: Now it belongs to God alone to call men to the mini≈øtery, Paul <hi>an Apo≈øtle, not of men, nor by men, but by Ie≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> Gal 1.1. <hi>The Father thru≈øts forth labourers into the harve≈øt.</hi> Mat. 9.38. <hi>And the Son gives pa≈øtors and teachers,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 4.11. And <hi>the holy Gho≈øt makes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeers,</hi> Acts 20.28. And the Churches power and authority to call and ordaine Mini≈øters is no more but a duty or ≈øervice whereby they te≈øtifie and declare and approve of them whom God hath called. Now they are called three waies; fir≈øt by men and not by God, thus all fal≈øe teachers are called. Secondly, when God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth men by the mini≈øtery of men, thus are all ordinary Mini≈øters of the word called. Thirdly, when men are called not by men but by Chri≈øt immediately, and ≈øo <hi>Paul</hi> and all the Apo≈øtles were called. Now this la≈øt manner of calling being extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cea≈øed with the Apo≈øtles; they were not only called immediately, but they were in≈øpired immediately, and ayded with an infallible a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of Gods ≈øpirit, of all this they had promi≈øes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.19.20. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. But now the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way to furni≈øh them with gifts is the Schooles of the Prophets, and if it plea≈øe the Lord to ≈øanctifie tho≈øe gifts, and to give them a willing heart to doe ≈øervice in the Church to the glory of God, and they have a lawfull ordination by the Church, this is the doore of the ≈øheep-fold, and he that thus enters into the fold of Chri≈øt is a true ≈øhepherd of the ≈øheep, neither may any preach publiquely but he that is thus called and fitted to take ≈øuch a charge upon him, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. So then it is not for men of other callings; <hi>He that warreth in this warfare mu≈øt not intangle him≈øelfe with the affaires of this life,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.4. And (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle) <hi>It is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon that we ≈øhould leave the word of God, and ≈øerve tables; but we will give our ≈øelves continually to prayer and to the mini≈øtery of the word,</hi> Acts 6.2.4. <hi>And who is ≈øufficient for the≈øe things?</hi> 2 Cor. 2.16.</p>
               <p>But it may be they will object the≈øe words of <hi>Paul; For ye may all prophe≈øie one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.31. I an≈øwer, this is Schooles di≈øputation. <hi>If any thinke him≈øelfe to be a Prophet, or ≈øpirituall, that is furni≈øhed with ≈øpirituall gifts, and have a willing inclination to be a Prophet, to the pray≈øe of God, and the good of the Church, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandements of the Lord,</hi> ver≈ø. 37. <hi>Let the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ≈øpeake, two or three, and let the other judge: the ≈øpirits of the Prophets are

               <p>Next, he blames both the Magi≈øtrates and Divines that are a≈ø≈øembled, for two things.

Again, <hi>there is but one body, and one ≈øpirit, one hope, one God, one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, one faith, one bapti≈øme,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 4.4. Then why ≈øhould not all our di≈øtractions and ≈øchi≈ømes be reduced to this one way of wor≈øhipping God, ≈øeeing all other ways mi≈ø≈øe of heaven? Again, the very end why God ≈øent Chri≈øt, <hi>was to gather together in one all things in Chri≈øt,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 1.10. And the example of the Primitive Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>they had all one heart and ≈øoule,</hi> Acts 4.32. <hi>And</hi> Paul <hi>exhorts to be of one mind, to live in peace, and the God of Peace and love be with you,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.11. Nay further ≈øaith he, <hi>I be≈øeech you brethren by the name of the Lord Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, that ye ≈øpeake the ≈øame thing, and that there be no divi≈øions among you, but that ye be perfectly joyned together in the ≈øame minde and in the ≈øame judgement,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.10. But will not they have our di≈øtractions and ≈øchi≈ømes reduced to one way of wor≈øhipping God, then ≈øaith <hi>Paul, marke them which cau≈øe divi≈øions and offences contrary to the doctrine that ye have learned, and avoid them; for they that are ≈øuch feare not the Lord Ie≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> Rom. 16.18. <hi>They would lead us from the ancient Prophets to walke in paths, in a way not ca≈øt up,</hi> Jer. 18.15. <hi>Let us enquire for the old way which is the good way, and we ≈øhall find re≈øt for our ≈øoules,</hi> Jer. 6.16.

               <p>The ≈øecond thing for which he blames the collective body of our Kingdome, for ≈øuppo≈øing that the land is ≈øcourged for this cau≈øe, that ≈øo many Religions are ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, affirming the contrary, that the cau≈øe of judgments, wrath and ≈øtripes is this, that all Religions are not ≈øuffered: his rea≈øon is, fir≈øt ≈øaith he, the con≈øciences of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcious men are as deare to them as their lives, 2. Hatred will pur≈øue them that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt Gods rule will judge men for their con≈øciences; this la≈øt rea≈øon is grounded upon a fal≈øe foundation, for they do not take upon them to judge the con≈øcience; we grant with him, that God alone is the judge of con≈øcience: and I have ≈øhewed at large, that Magi≈øtrates do but command the outward man, as his words and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and if they offend herein, they may puni≈øh them in their bodies and goods, ≈øo then they may command outward conformity in the wor≈øhip of God, and if they be Hypocrites, it is from them≈øelves who are not obedient to Gods command, which alone reacheth the heart: It is true, we mu≈øt obey them for con≈øcience ≈øake, yet not from their command, but from Gods command, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. Now for his rea≈øon that is built upon this, he ≈øaith, what hatred mu≈øt needs pur≈øue them that bring all religions into one, although it may be proved the true Religion; but ≈øaith Chri≈øt: <hi>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you: If ye were of the world the world would love his owne: but becau≈øe I have taken you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you,</hi> John 15.18, 19. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are ye when men revile you, and ≈øay al manner of evil again≈øt you fal≈øely for my names ≈øake,</hi> Math. 5.11. But ≈øaith he, our con≈øciences are as deare to us as our lives. I an≈øw. if their con≈øeience be dearer then Gods word, they may quickly be deluded with a blinde con≈øcience, and may kill Gods people, and think they do God ≈øervice, <hi>John</hi> 16.2. And that Strumpet in the <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.20. can wipe her mouth, and ≈øay ≈øhe hath done no wickedne≈ø≈øe; and we ≈øeldome heare a Malefactor plead guilty; then is con≈øcience ≈øuch a perfect rule, or mu≈øt it rule the Word of God, or Gods word rule the con≈øcience? But he replyes that every mans judgement is truth to him≈øelfe, as theirs is to them. I grant it, but the word of God mu≈øt rule over all. Neither doe they take upon them to frame a government for the Church, but they ≈øearch the word, and endeavour to find out that forme that God him≈øelfe hath ≈øet down in his word; and I doubt not, but ere long, if they humbly ≈øubmit them≈øelves to the Lord, and be a≈øhamed of their owne wayes, that they have a long time walked in, that the Lord will ≈øhew them the forme of the hou≈øe, and the fa≈øhion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and all the formes thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the lawes thereof, and write it in their ≈øight, that they may keepe the whole forme thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them, <hi>Ezek</hi> 43.11.

               <p>FIr≈øt, they are part of the Church of Chri≈øt: I hope if the parents be admitted, the children are not rejected before that they di≈øcover their de≈øert to be ju≈øtly ca≈øt out; well, then I take it for granted, that they are reputed members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chri≈øt; and therefore they ought to be baptized. <hi>For we are all baptized into one body, whether Iewes or Gentiles, bond or free, and have been made all to drinke into one ≈øpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12, 13. Then why ≈øhould Infants be debatred of this benefit which is their due, and Chri≈øt at his fir≈øt in≈øtitution of Bapti≈øme <hi>≈øent out his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles to baptize all Nations,</hi> Math. 28.19. They were commanded to baptize all Nations: hence I gather, that in the in≈øtitution of bapti≈øme, Chri≈øt made no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nation, age, nor ≈øexes; but the commandement is ≈øpoken in a generall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, baptize all, then let us take heed le≈øt we limit or ≈øtraighten the command of Chri≈øt. <hi>And all the countrey of</hi> Judea, <hi>and all the region round about</hi> Jordan <hi>were baptized of</hi> John <hi>in Iordan,</hi> Math. 3.5, 6. But were there no children in all Judea, nor in all the region round about Jordan? or were they not baptized, when it is ≈øaid all were baptized? I ≈øuppo≈øe they will grant that there were children, but they will ≈øay, they did not come to be baptized: for they that came, confe≈ø≈øed their ≈øins, <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 6. I an≈øwer, if they came not then all did not come; but the Text ≈øaith, all came.

               <p>Secondly, the Apo≈øtles practi≈øe ≈øheweth, that they under≈øtood that infants were included in that command of Chri≈øt; for when they came to any family, if but the parents beleeved, and were baptized, they baptized all the hou≈øhold. <hi>When</hi> Lydia <hi>was converted, ≈øhe was baptized and all her hou≈øhold. And the Apo≈øtle told the Iaylor, that if he beleeved on the Lord Ie≈øus, he ≈øhould be ≈øaved and all his hou≈øe; and the ≈øame houre of the night he took them and wa≈øhed their ≈øtripes, and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then if the Apo≈øtles under≈øtood Chri≈øt to ≈øpeak in generall to all Nations, ≈øexes, and ages without exception, why ≈øhould we make que≈øtion of it? ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>marke them which walke ≈øo, as yee have us for an example,</hi> Phil. 3.15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Infants were circumci≈øed, and bapti≈øme is come in the place of it, why then ≈øhould not Infants of Chri≈øtians be baptized? did Chri≈øt come to rob Infants of that benefit which they had before his comming, or did he not rather come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his mercies to them? hee came to breake downe the partition wall, that all might partake of his free mercy, which is not le≈ø≈øe then it was before, but greater; Fir≈øt, in giving bapti≈øme in ≈øtead of circumci≈øion, which is far ea≈øier; Secondly, by
<pb facs="tcp:155189:33"/>admitting all Nations to partake of it, which before was to the Jewes onely; 3. In that bapti≈øme more clearely ≈øignifies our Regeneration then Circumci≈øion did; hence I gather, that if Chri≈øt hath given us a clearer ≈øignification then before, our children ≈øhall not have le≈ø≈øe, if God did not only give Parents the ≈øeales of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but their Infants al≈øo; will not God do ≈øo to Infants of Chri≈øtians? ≈øhall we thinke that when Chri≈øt put his own name upon them, calling them Chri≈øtians, that he took away part of their benefit? If God made a Covenant with the Jewes for them and their Children, and many gracious promi≈øes in it, which promi≈øes &amp; ≈øeals al≈øo were made over to their Infants: is this, ≈øo great a benefit, taken from our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants? did God ≈øay to <hi>Abraham, I will be thy God, and the God of thy ≈øeed al≈øo,</hi> Gen. 17.19. And the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith to their po≈øterity, <hi>ye are the children of the Covenant which God made with our Fathers.</hi> Acts 3.25. But doth not the ≈øame <hi>Peter</hi> ≈øay al≈øo, that the promi≈øe is to you and to your children, therefore be ye bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized every one of you? meaning all you that the promi≈øes belong to; be ye every one baptized, both ye and your children: Then why ≈øhould not Infants be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? <hi>If but one of the Parents beleeve, the children are holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.14. <hi>If the rootes be holy, ≈øo are the branches,</hi> Rom. 11.16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Infants may receive the ≈øeedes of grace by the Almighty power and wi≈øedome of God, although the manner of working it in them be not known to us: for ≈øaith Chri≈øt; <hi>except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye ≈øhall not enter into the Kingdome of heaven; And who≈øoever ≈øhall humble him≈øelfe as this little child, ≈øhal be greate≈øt in the Kingdome of heaven; And who≈øoever ≈øhall offend one of the≈øe little ones that beleeve in me, &amp;c.</hi> Math. 16.2.3.4.6.

But doth Chri≈øt call them and charge them not to keep them backe from him, and dare any be ≈øo bold to with≈øtand this charge of Chri≈øt, and as much as in them lyes, deprvive their ≈øoules of all ≈øpirituall good, what de≈øperate ≈øoule-murderers be the≈øe? they are like unto the daughters of Jeru≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, who in that great famine and terrible ≈øiege, were more cruell to their ≈øuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infants then the ≈øea mon≈øters, or like the E≈øtridges in the wilderne≈ø≈øe, <hi>Lam</hi> 4.3. The pretious ≈øons of Sion <hi>comparable to fine gold. were e≈øteemed as earthen pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> ver≈ø. 2. So the≈øe men, when Chri≈øt highly commends, and greatly delights in young Infants, the≈øe cruell parents think them not worthy of their ≈øociety in divine ordinances; how doe they know but they were ≈øanctified in the wombe as well as

But was <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øanctified from the wombe, who was the fir≈øt Mini≈øter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of bapti≈øme? what is this, but to informe <hi>Iohn</hi> that Infants from the womb are fitted for bapti≈øme? And again, Chri≈øt was conceived by the holy Gho≈øt to ≈øanctifie Infancy a≈øwel as any other age, that none may be excepted again≈øt; then how dare the≈øe men make exceptions where Chri≈øt makes none? then may Infants be ≈øancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the wombe, and receive the holy Gho≈øt from the wombe; Then ≈øaith <hi>Peter, can any man forbid that the≈øe ≈øhould be baptized that have received the holy Gho≈øt a≈øwell as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord,</hi> Acts 10.47, 48.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the Apo≈øtles did baptize them <hi>that did but in a generall way confe≈ø≈øe that Chri≈øt was the Son of God,</hi> Acts 8.37, 38. And they baptized <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> &amp; many in Samaria, when as yet the holy Gho≈øt was fallen upon none of them, onely they were baptized in the name of the Lord Je≈øus: <hi>Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the holy Gho≈øt,</hi> ≈øee <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15, 16.17. And the Apo≈øtles finding certaine De≈øciples, ≈øaid unto them, have ye received the holy Gho≈øt ≈øince ye beleeved? that is, have ye received the ≈øpeciall gifts and graces of the holy Gho≈øt ≈øince ye beleeved with a generall faith; but ≈øay they, we have not ≈øo much as heard whether there be any holy Gho≈øt: and he ≈øaid unto them, <hi>unto what were ye bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? and they ≈øaid, unto</hi> Johns <hi>bapti≈øme,</hi> Acts 19.1, 2, 3. Here you ≈øee them bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized that can make but a weake account of their faith; why may not Infants born of Chri≈øtians be baptized much rather then the≈øe?</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized them with water unto repentance: but ≈øaith he, <hi>he that commeth after me, ≈øhall baptize you with the holy Gho≈øt,</hi> Mat. 3.11. That is, when Chri≈øt by his ≈øpirit ≈øhall make that bapti≈øme by water effectuall by the inward working of the holy Gho≈øt, <hi>and yet all this but one bapti≈øme,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 4.5. And <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øpeaking to tho≈øe that were baptized with water, and yet were ignorant of the holy Gho≈øt, ≈øaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> baptizeth unto repentance, and ≈øaith to the people, that they ≈øhould beleeve on him that ≈øhould come after him, that is, on Je≈øus Chri≈øt; <hi>And when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Ie≈øus, and</hi> Paul <hi>laid his hands on them, and the holy Gho≈øt came on them,</hi> Acts 19.5.6. Now this was not another Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øme, but onely the inward bapti≈øme of the holy Gho≈øt, as <hi>Iohn</hi> had told them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how that he which came after him ≈øhould baptize tho≈øe with the holy Gho≈øt, which then only received the outward forme, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. Then if this be ≈øo, why may not Infants of Chri≈øtians now be baptized unto repentance a≈øwell as the≈øe? But our Anabapti≈øts will have Chri≈øt to be the forerunner of <hi>Iohn,</hi> to baptize them fir≈øt with the holy Gho≈øt, and then <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øhall baptize them with water, and ≈øo Chri≈øt ≈øhall prepare the way for <hi>Iohn,</hi> and not <hi>Iohn</hi> for Chri≈øt; <hi>But the ≈øpirit is like the wind, and we cannot tell whence it commeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Seventhly, we may take notice of the two Sacraments of the Jewes compared with ours, and their agreement together: fir≈øt, concerning their Pa≈ø≈øeover, it was required that they ≈øhould know the thing ≈øignified by it, and that they ≈øhould ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and clean≈øe them≈øelves before they did receive it; and when King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ≈øuppo≈øed that ≈øome of ≈øeverall Tribes had not ≈øufficiently prepared them≈øelves, and yet had been at that Sacrament, he prayed for them, ≈øaying; <hi>The good Lord pardon them, and the Lord hearkened to</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>and healed the people,</hi> 2 Chron. 30.18.19.20. And (≈øaith <hi>Mo≈øes</hi>) concerning ≈øome that were defiled and had not clean≈øed them≈øelves, therfore they could not keep the Pa≈ø≈øover on that day, <hi>Num.</hi> 9.6. Now to this Pa≈ø≈øover our Lords Supper doth well agree, which requires examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and knowledge of the thing ≈øignified, and a remembrance of the death of Chri≈øt till his comming againe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. But for the other Sacrament of the Jewes, was nothing required of them if ≈øo be they were but children of circumci≈øed Jewes, and bapti≈øme is come in the place of it? why then ≈øhould more be required of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren then was of the children of the Jewes? let them an≈øwer if they can.</p>
               <p>But ≈øuppo≈øe they ≈øhould require ≈øome qualification in our children, why may we not an≈øwer that children are the heritage of the Lord? <hi>P≈øa.</hi> 127.3. then why ≈øhould they be kept from this ordinance of bapti≈øme? Again, children were in the Temple and ≈øang Ho≈øanna to the ≈øonne of <hi>David</hi> to the a≈øtoni≈øhment of the Prie≈øts and Scribes, yet to the great approbation of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who ≈øaid to the Prie≈øts, have yee not read <hi>that cut of the monthes of babes and ≈øucklings thou ha≈øt perfected prai≈øe,</hi> Mat. 21.15, 16.

But doth Chri≈øt here acknowledge an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall perfection to be in the prai≈øe of babes and ≈øucklings? then who dares to keep them from the ordinance of bapti≈øme? Again, Chri≈øt ≈øaith, of ≈øuch is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, then who dares to make que≈øtion of that which Chri≈øt affirmes? and he kindly embraced them, which he would not have done if they had not beene part of his Kingdom, neither could he be deceived, becau≈øe he knew their hearts, and he prayed for them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.13. and his prayers were alwaies heard, Luke 11.42. neither would he pray for the world, but only for tho≈øe that were given him, 17.9. and he ble≈ø≈øed them; but who are ble≈ø≈øed of Chri≈øt but they who≈øe ≈øinnes are forgiven? <hi>P≈øa.</hi> 32.1.

But they will ≈øay, tho≈øe in the Go≈øpell are to be under≈øtood babes in Chri≈øt or young converts: To this I an≈øwer, <hi>when they brought them to Chri≈øt, he tooke them up in his armes when he ble≈ø≈øed them,</hi> Mat. 10.16. which ≈øhe wes plainely that they were litle children. Secondly, the Di≈øciples call them young children and litle children <hi>ver.</hi> 13. and <hi>Luke</hi> ≈øaith, they brought unto him Infants, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.15. <hi>And when Chri≈øt called a litle child unto him,</hi> Mat. 18.2. <hi>he ≈øet him in the mid≈øt of them,</hi> which argues plainely that he had him in his armes; but ≈øee <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.36. there you ≈øhall ≈øee in plaine words that he took that very child in his armes and ≈øpake unto them. Thirdly, Chri≈øt ≈øaith unto his Di≈øciples, who were ≈øtrong Chri≈øtians; <hi>except ye be converted and become as litle Children, ye ≈øhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> but now will tho≈øe men who ≈øay this place is meant of babes in Chri≈øt or young converts, will they I ≈øay make their inference thus, that ≈øtrong chri≈øtians mu≈øt become weak in faith? yea the Apo≈øtles mu≈øt become as babes in Chri≈øt, their ≈øtrong faith mu≈øt become weake againe, or el≈øe they cannot enter into heaven; <hi>the≈øe men declare their folly as</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>delareth her ≈øin,</hi> I≈øa. 3.9. For doth not Chri≈øt often blame a weak faith, ≈øee <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.26.14.31. and doth he not highly commend a ≈øtrong faith? <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.10.15.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. Then the true meaning is this, the Di≈øciples had beene rea≈øoning who ≈øhould be the greate≈øt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.1. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.34. then Chri≈øt tooke a young child in nature up in his armes to convince their pride and envy, as the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <hi>in malice be ye children, but in under≈øtanding be ye men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. So here in pride and envy Chri≈øt would have them to be as children, ≈øaying, except yee bee converted from your pride and envy yee cannot be ≈øaved; that is, your pride and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy mu≈øt be mortified &amp; crucified w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> makes you affect high places; <hi>he that would be fir≈øt, the ≈øame ≈øhalbe la≈øt &amp; ≈øervant of all,</hi> Mar. 9.35.36. So, then the Di≈øciples were already converted from the ≈øtate of nature to the ≈øtate of grace, but yet they were not ≈øufficiently converted from their pride &amp; envy; ≈øo then you ≈øee all the≈øe te≈øtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Chri≈øt to be concerning young children in nature, and not of young converts being growne in age; therefore infants having ≈øuch approbation and te≈øtimony from the mouth of Chri≈øt, I ≈øay againe, who dares hinder them from the ordinance of bapti≈øme?</p>
               <p>Eightly, from the ends of bapti≈øme, which are the≈øe. Fir≈øt, it is a pledge unto us in regard of our weakne≈ø≈øe, to a≈ø≈øure us of all the graces and mercies of God, &amp; e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of our union with Chri≈øt, and of remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins, and both mortification of them, and vivification to ari≈øe from them to newne≈ø≈øe of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3.4. <hi>For
<pb facs="tcp:155189:35"/>he that is baptized into Chri≈øt, hath put on Chri≈øt,</hi> Gal. 3.27. The ≈øecond end of our bapti≈øme is to di≈øtingui≈øh Chri≈øtians from Tuckes and Pagans; for it is a ≈øigne of our Chri≈øtian profe≈ø≈øion again≈øt all the enemies of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, as Circumci≈øion was a token of the Covenant, ≈øaith the Lord, between me and thee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. Chri≈øtians may ≈øay as <hi>David</hi> did; <hi>Thy vowes are upon me O God, I will render prai≈øe unto thee,</hi> P≈øal. 56.11. The third end of our bapti≈øme, it is a meanes of our entrance or admi≈ø≈øion into the vi≈øible Church of Chri≈øt, for ≈øaith Chri≈øt; <hi>Except a man be borne of water and the ≈øpirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God,</hi> John 3.5. The Kingdome of God here hath a double ≈øignification an≈øwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the double qualification: ≈øometimes it is meant the vi≈øible Church; ≈øo then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be baptized with water, he cannot enter into it, &amp; it is al≈øo meant heaven it ≈øelfe, and ≈øo a man mu≈øt be borne of the holy Gho≈øt, or el≈øe he cannot enter into it. The fourth end of our bapti≈øme, it is a meanes of our unity with the Church and people of God; <hi>For we are all baptized into one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. <hi>There is one body and one ≈øpirit, and one hope of our calling; one Lord, one faith, one bapti≈øme, one God and Father of all, who is above and through all, and in you all,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 4.4, 5, 6. Then would you have a pledge of Gods love to you in regard of your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that they are united to Chri≈øt, and their ≈øins forgiven and mortified, and that they are ri≈øen with Chri≈øt to the life of grace? then let them be baptized.</p>
               <p>And would you have them di≈øtingui≈øhed from the enemies of Chri≈øt, and to have a ≈øigne and a badge of their Chri≈øtian profe≈ø≈øion before the world? then let them bee baptized.</p>
               <p>And would you have them to be admitted into the Vi≈øible Church of Chri≈øt? then let them be baptized.</p>
               <p>And would you have them to enjoy the priviledges of the Church, and to be at peace and unity with the people of God? then let them be baptized.</p>
               <p>But ≈øome will here demand, whether bapti≈øme be of ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity to ≈øalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or not; I an≈øwer, to make covenant with God, and to be in the ≈øaid covenant, is of ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity to ≈øalvation, for unle≈ø≈øe God be our God in Covenant, and we his ≈øervants, we cannot be ≈øaved; now bapti≈øme is the ≈øeale of this Covenant, and therefore nece≈ø≈øary but in part; 1. In re≈øpect of Gods command, who hath enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us to u≈øe it, 2. In re≈øpect of our weakne≈ø≈øe that have need of all helper that may confirme our faith: yet bapti≈øme is not ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øalvation. For the want of bapti≈øme doth not condemne the children of beleeving Parents, if they dye before bapti≈øme, when it cannot be had; for they being holy, theirs is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, although they dye before bapti≈øme; the thiefe upon the cro≈ø≈øe, and many other holy Martyrs dyed before bapti≈øme, that are now in the Kingdome of heaven; and tho≈øe parents that ≈ølighted this ordinance, ≈øo that their children dyed without it, if they repent of that ≈øin, it may be forgiven, and their ≈øoules may be ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for all that, yet it is of very dangerous con≈øequence to ≈ølight or contemn any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, it is damnable of it ≈øelfe without repentance. There was a law in I≈ørael, that the uncircumci≈øed man-child, who≈øe fle≈øh of his foreskin is not circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed,
<pb facs="tcp:155189:36"/>that ≈øoule ≈øhalbe cut off from his people; the rea≈øon is rendred, becau≈øe ≈øaith the Lord, <hi>he hath broken my Covenant,</hi> Gen. 17.14. Now it was not the Infant that de≈øpi≈øed or ≈ølighted the Covenant: but it was the parents that ≈øinned, by ≈ølighting or de≈øpi≈øing the ordinance of God, and did procure this judgment upon their child; al≈øo the childe when he came to age refu≈øed to be circumci≈øed; and ≈øo hee broke the Covenant of God, and therefore he was cut off from the people; and why may not this be a ju≈øt judgement of God upon the Parents neglect of the ordinance of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øme which is come in the place of circumci≈øion? And if the Lord were ≈øo ≈øevere with tho≈øe that were not circumci≈øed, which was a heavy burden for Infants to beare, ≈øee <hi>Ezod.</hi> 4.26. How much more now bapti≈øme is come in the place of it, which is far ea≈øier; <hi>But wa≈øh and be cleane,</hi> 2 Kings 5.13. Then let them take heed how they neglect this ordinance of God: for when they expect to have them an≈øwer for them≈øelves, they may ju≈øtly an≈øwer with contempt, and de≈øpi≈øe the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and ≈øo for ever be cut off from his people, and from the vi≈øible Church, and ≈øo by that meanes debard from the ordinary means of ≈øalvation. <hi>For the Lord addeth to his Church daily ≈øuch as ≈øhalbe ≈øaved,</hi> Acts 3.47. Yet I grant that place is chiefly to be under≈øtood of the Invi≈øible Church, into which who ≈øoever ≈øhall enter, being the Kingdome of grace, ≈øhall without faile come to the Kingdome of glory for ever. <hi>But except a man be borne of water,</hi> that is, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with water <hi>he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God</hi> here, which is the vi≈øible Church, and he that is entred into it is either in the invi≈øible or in Gods way to it, which is nothing el≈øe but heaven begun, and heaven is nothing el≈øe but grace perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. <hi>We al with open face beholding as in a gla≈ø≈øe the glory of the Lord, &amp; are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the ≈øame Image from glory to glory, even by the ≈øpirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. But they will object and ≈øay, that Infants cannot be knowne to us that they are indeed the children of God, and if they be not, ≈øay they, we may not to baptize them. I an≈øwer, the ≈øame may be ≈øaid of men of yeares, for we know not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether they be the children of God or no: therefore by this argument we may not only exclude Infants from bapti≈øme, but men of years, yea all ≈øexes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from both Sacraments, and ≈øo admit of none at all into the Church of God. But to come a little nearer to them, do they beleeve that the patents are the children of God, and in Covenant with him? then they ought to beleeve the ≈øame of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren till they manife≈øt by their wicked life to the contrary. For is God the God of the Parents and not the God of their ≈øeed? this is flat again≈øt the tenor of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; Therefore if the child have a right to the Covenant, he mu≈øt needs have a right to the ≈øeale of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they object that Infants have no faith, and therefore bapti≈øme is of no u≈øe to them. I an≈øwer, they may have the ≈øeeds of faith and regeneration, although we know it not; <hi>For without faith it is unpo≈ø≈øible to plea≈øe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. <hi>And he that beleeveth not ≈øhalbe damned,</hi> Mar. 16.16. But how≈øoever they have an infolded faith, becau≈øe that their parents by their faith receive the promi≈øe of God both for them≈øelves and their children, ≈øo that the faith of the Parents is al≈øo the
<pb facs="tcp:155189:36"/>faith of their children. And th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> to be born of Chri≈øtian parents, and in the Church of Chri≈øt, is in ≈øtead of the profe≈ø≈øion of faith, and ≈øo it wil be u≈øefull and profitable for Infants to be baptized.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they will object that Infants know not what is done when they are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. I an≈øwer, no more did tho≈øe Infants that were circumci≈øed, yet it was u≈øefull to them and their parents both to have the Covenant ≈øealed unto them, and is it not the ≈øame al≈øo to Chri≈øtian Infants? many benefits come with it, it is a meanes to admit them into the fellow≈øhip of the vi≈øible Church, and by that meanes made right members of it. For as the Father makes a purcha≈øe for him≈øelfe and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and they being Infants at the time of the ≈øealing of it, and ≈øo not able to know what was done, yet the purcha≈øe is not in vaine for them; but as tho≈øe Infants grow to under≈øtanding they can rejoyce that they have an intere≈øt in their Fathers pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øe; ≈øo will Infants baptized, when they come to under≈øtanding they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the great love of God that ≈øhould vouch≈øafe to take them into Covenant, and ≈øeale ≈øo many gracious promi≈øes unto them in the Sacrament of bapti≈øine, which will be an engagement to them all their days, to endeavour to keepe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they will object that the weakne≈ø≈øe of the Infant is ≈øuch, that the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of the water to be dived into it, may be the death of the Infant; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øay they, it were better to let them grow to more ≈øtrength, and to take the warmne≈ø≈øe of the Summer ≈øea≈øon, rather then to endanger the life of the Infant. I an≈øwer, it is true that dipping the child doth more re≈øemble our ≈øpirituall wa≈øhing, for ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>we are buried with him by bapti≈øme into his death, that like as Chri≈øt was rai≈øed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ≈øo we al≈øo ≈øhould walke in newne≈ø≈øe of life. If we be planted in the likene≈ø≈øe of his death, we ≈øhalbe in the likene≈ø≈øe of his re≈øurrection,</hi> Rom. 6.4.5. But there is no nece≈ø≈øity of dipping the Infant to endanger the health and life of it in the≈øe cold countries, when as the word baptizing ≈øignifies not only ≈øuch a wa≈øhing that is by diving of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into the water, but that al≈øo which is by ≈øprinkling water upon it, and the Lord ≈øaith by the Prophet, ≈øpeaking of the≈øe times under the Go≈øpell. <hi>Then will I ≈øprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle cleane water upon you, and ye ≈øhalbe cleane from all your ≈øilthine≈ø≈øe,</hi> Ezek. 36.25. Therefore without all que≈øtion in the≈øe cold Countries ≈øprinkling is accepted.</p>

But what mode≈øty were it for a man or woman grown of age to go naked into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be baptized, whether it be before one man or before the whole congregation? ≈øaith <hi>Paul, let all things be done decently,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.10. Again, we are taught to pray the Lord to keep us out of temptation, and we have the example of <hi>David's</hi> fearfull fall into adultery and murder by ≈øeeing a naked woman wa≈øhing her ≈øelfe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Ab≈øtaine from all appearance of ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>es are to be baptized, therefore we ≈øhould have regard to mode≈øty, and to keep out of temptation.</p>
               <p>Fifly, it may be they will object and ≈øay, if the Infant be ≈øprinkled but on one part and not on another, then it is baptized but in one part and not in another, and therefore no true bapti≈øme: I an≈øwer in the words of Chri≈øt, <hi>if I wa≈øh thee not, thou ha≈øt no part with me;</hi> yet ≈øaith he to <hi>Peter he that is wa≈øhed needeth not ≈øave to wa≈øh his feet and is cleane every whit,</hi> John 13.10. Here <hi>Peter</hi> thought it had beene better to be wa≈øhed all over: but the an≈øwer of Chri≈øt is, that one part is ≈øufficient, and circumci≈øion was not in all parts but in one part, and yet the Infant was by the vertue of that one place circumci≈øed all over; So Bapti≈øme doth infu≈øe it ≈øelfe into all parts of the man, and into all parts of his life, and into all places whither≈øoever hee comes; therefore that bapti≈øine that is by ≈øprinkling the Infant is a true bapti≈øme, and I have already ≈øhewed the danger of neglecting this ordinance: and here I may tell you againe, that the Lord met <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and ≈øought to kill him becau≈øe that his child was not circumci≈øed, thereupon his wife in her rage and fury went her ≈øelfe and circumci≈øed him which was her great ≈øin; <hi>yet the Lord in his great mercy pa≈ø≈øed by all becau≈øe the thing was done, and ≈øo the Lord let him goe,</hi> Exod. 4.24, 25, 26. then take heed of carnall rea≈øoning again≈øt Gods ordinance. Then I conclude, that in hot Countries and for men of yeares, diving may rather be u≈øed; but in cold Countries and to Infants, ≈øprinkling may ≈øuffice, which al≈øo is the cu≈øtome of our Churches and ought not altogether to be de≈øpi≈øed, ≈øee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. where <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>if any man ≈øeeme to be contentious, we have no ≈øuch cu≈øtome, neither the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God;</hi> and when I≈ørael had no ≈øetled Church, but travelled from one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to another, in ≈øuch a ca≈øe circumci≈øion might be laid a≈øide, and yet did not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Lord; <hi>But he remembers their kindne≈ø≈øe when they followed him in the wilderne≈ø≈øe, then I≈ørael was holine≈ø≈øe to the Lord, and the fir≈øt fruits of his increa≈øe.</hi> Jer. 2.2, 3. Although they laid circumci≈øion a≈øide for a ≈øpace of time; and there is much difference betweene a ≈øetled Church and the fir≈øt planting of the Go≈øpel; when the Apo≈øtles preached, it was to men of yeares, and ≈øuch they baptized that were pre≈øent, and they were out of the Covenant; but we are children of Chri≈øtians, and ≈øome of our fathers were in covenant with God and had the ≈øeale of it, which is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øme: <hi>And we are the children of the Covenant which God made with our fathers,</hi> Acts 3 23. The≈øe things well con≈øidered, let the Reader judge whether God will accept the ≈øprinkling of Infants at their receiving of Bapti≈øme in this cold Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, they object that the bapti≈øme of Infants is grounded upon no in≈øtitution of Chri≈øt: I an≈øwer, that Chri≈øt ≈øent his Apo≈øtles to baptize all Nations, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles practi≈øe where they came baptized whole hou≈øholds, as I ≈øhewed before; and the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaking of the whole Church, ≈øaith, <hi>we are all baptized into one body.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. And the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaking of I≈øraels going through the red Sea, ≈øaith, <hi>they were all baptized in the ≈øea,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.3.4. Now if all Nations, all
<pb facs="tcp:155189:37"/>Hou≈øholds, and all the Church was baptized, where will they find that Infants were excepted again≈øt to be debarred of this ordinance of God? Let them but with an upright con≈øcience tell me what they think, whether Infants be no part of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Hou≈øholds, or of the Church of God, and then tell mee whether baptizing of them bee not grovnded upon the in≈øtitution of Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p n="7">7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>ly, they object &amp; ≈øay, that place in <hi>Mar.</hi> 18. is not meant of infants, but of good big ones w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> were able to goe &amp; an≈øwer for them≈øelvs: this I have an≈øwered already, but ≈øaith Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in his In≈øtitutions 416.7. they are called by the Evangeli≈øt <hi>Brephe</hi> and <hi>Paidia,</hi> by which words the Greekes doe ≈øignifie babes yet hanging. on the brea≈øts, therefore this word (<hi>to come</hi>) is plainely meant, to have acce≈ø≈øe; loe (≈øaith he) what ≈ønares they are compelled to make which are hardned again≈øt the truth: &amp; where they ≈øay that the Kingdom of heaven is not given to Infants, but to ≈øuch as be like them, but this is no ≈øounder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the re≈øt; for the very intent &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chri≈øt is to ≈øhew that Infants in age are not ≈øtrangers to him, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth that Infants be ≈øuffered to have acce≈ø≈øe unto him; nothing is plainer then that very infancy indeed is there ≈øpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of, &amp; where he addeth, <hi>of ≈øuch is the Kingdom Heaven,</hi> in this word ≈øuch, are meant very Infants them≈øelves and ≈øuch as be like them. Now to compare tho≈øe actions and carriage of Chri≈øt to tho≈øe infants with the ≈øignification of bapti≈øme together, and it will appeare to have the ≈øame ≈øignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Then if Infants be brought to Chri≈øt, why is it not meet that they ≈øhould be received to bapti≈øme which is the ≈øigne of our communion &amp; fellow≈øhip with Chri≈øt? and if the Kingdome of Heaven be theirs, why ≈øhould the ≈øigne thereof bee denied them? whereby there is as it were an entry made into the Church of God, that ≈øo they may be numbred among the heirs of the heavenly Kingdome; and by our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øme we te≈øtifie that Infants are contained in the Covenant of God; and doth not that which Chri≈øt did to them the ≈øame? his receiving and imbracing, laying his hands on them &amp; praying for them, doth not all this declare that they are his, &amp; that they are ≈øanctified of him? for (≈øaith he) <hi>I pray not for the world, but for tho≈øe that thou ha≈øt given me out of the world,</hi> John 17.9.

               <p> Eightly, they will object and ≈øay, that it is no where found that any one Infant was ever baptized by the hand of any of the Apo≈øtles. I an≈øwer, although it be not expre≈øly by name ≈øet downe by the Evangeli≈øts, yet it is plainly implyed, when it is ≈øaid that they baptized <hi>Lydia</hi> and her hou≈øhold, and the Jaylor and all his, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15.23. But if all this will not ≈øuffice to an≈øwer them, I reply, that by the ≈øame argument women may be debard from the other Sacrament the Lords Supper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that we read of none that received it in the Apo≈øtles times: but if we ob≈øerve and con≈øider well what the in≈øtrution requireth, by that we may know to whom the u≈øe of the Lords Supper ought to be communicated; now the ≈øame rule is to be ob≈øerved in bapti≈øme, for when we con≈øider to what end it was ordained, we may ea≈øily ≈øee that it belongs a≈øwel to Infants as to elder folks; ≈øo that if they be deprived of it, the will of Chri≈øt is manife≈øtly defrauded, then lot us not beleeve their lyes, when they ≈øay that bapti≈øme of Infants was not in the Apo≈øtles times. <hi>But try the ≈øpirits whether they be of God,</hi> 1 John 4.1. <hi>And ≈øearch the Scripture daily, and ≈øee whether tho≈øe things be ≈øo,</hi> Acts 17.11.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, they will object that although Infants were Circumci≈øed, yet it will not follow that they ≈øhould be baptized, becau≈øe that the ≈øigns &amp; the Covenant are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and al≈øo the names of the children. For fir≈øt ≈øay they, Circumci≈øion was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of mortification &amp; not of bapti≈øme; ≈øo I ≈øay too, that mortification is the thing ≈øignified by both: hence I conclude that bapti≈øme doth rightly come in the place of Circumci≈øion, becau≈øe that they both do ≈øignifie the ≈øame thing. 2. Whereas they affirm the difference of the Covenant, they are forced to wre≈øt the Scriptures with audacious boldne≈ø≈øe, and all becau≈øe they would make them ≈øpeake a damnable lye which is this. They ≈øay that the Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> did not exceed this temporal life, &amp; al the promi≈øes therein contained are but for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things; but if this be ≈øo, hence it wil follow that the Jewes were only filled with benefits like ≈øwine fatted with huskes, and ≈øo at length did peri≈øh with eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: for ≈øay they, Circumci≈øion was but a litterall ≈øigne, and the promi≈øes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were but carnall. To this I reply, that Hereticks may draw the ≈øame inference from bapti≈øme, for ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>we are circumci≈øed in Chri≈øt in putting off the body of the ≈øins of the fle≈øh by the Circumci≈øion of Chri≈øt,</hi> (and pre≈øently he addeth) <hi>buried with him in bapti≈øme,</hi> Col. 2.11, 12. Thus you ≈øee that bapti≈øme is directly in the place of Circumci≈øion, and the fulfilling of bapti≈øme is al≈øo the fulfilling of Circumci≈øion, for they figure unto us both the ≈øame thing, yet I deny not but the land of Canaan with many temporall ble≈ø≈øings, was infolded in this promi≈øe, yet not as the chiefe, which was Chri≈øt, and in him all ≈øpirituall and eternall ble≈ø≈øings, <hi>that the ble≈ø≈øing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come on the Gentiles through Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, that we might receive the promi≈øe of the ≈øpirit through faith,</hi> Gal. 3.14.

They ≈øay that in the old Te≈øtament they were called the
<pb facs="tcp:155189:38"/>children of <hi>Abraham</hi> becau≈øe they carne of him, and now none but the faithfull are called <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, therefore ≈øay they that carnall Infancy which was by Circumci≈øion grafted into the fellow≈øhip of the Covenant figured the Infants of the new Te≈øtament which are regenerated by the word of God to immortall life. This is a truth, but yet it is not the whole truth; for as the Serpent beguiled <hi>Eve,</hi> ≈øo doth this ≈øubtile Sophi≈øter ≈øeek to ≈øeduce tho≈øe little ones that beleeve in Chri≈øt. 1. Here you ≈øee that he excludes all our Infants from having any right in Chri≈øt, becau≈øe ≈øaith he, the circumci≈øing of Infants, and receiving them, or ingrafting them into the fellow≈øhip of the Covenant, ≈øignified tho≈øe under the new Te≈øtament, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by the Word, which no Infant can be; yet I have proved before that they may have the ≈øeeds of faith &amp; regeneration wrought in them by the ≈øpirit of God, although the manner how it is wrought in them be hidden from us: then why ≈øhould he exclude the≈øe Infants? Again, he calls them all carnall Infants that were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øed before that they manife≈øt them≈øelves ≈øo to be; not con≈øidering that God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ≈øanctifie them, and to give them the gifts of the holy Gho≈øt from their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, as I have ≈øhewed in <hi>Ieremiah</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bapti≈øt. Again, <hi>Abraham</hi> was called the Father of the faithfull, a≈øwell to Jewes as Chri≈øtians; for when a company of wicked wretches called them≈øelves the children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>if ye were the children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>you would do the workes of</hi> Abraham; <hi>Ye are of your father the Divell, and the lu≈øts of your father ye will doe,</hi> John 8.39.44. <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>rejoyced to ≈øee my day, and ye goe about to kill me, this did not</hi> Abraham, <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 56.40.

Yet God was plea≈øed particularly to imbrace the ≈øeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> with his mercie, and that the ≈øame mercy might be the more witne≈ø≈øed to them, he gave them the ≈øeal of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øion ≈øo like unto this is the Chri≈øtian Church when the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts receive the ≈øeal of the covenant, ≈øo mu≈øt the children al≈øo; <hi>For if the root be holy, ≈øo are the branches,</hi> Ro. 11.16. <hi>Yea, if but one of the parents beleeve, the children are holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.14.

<pb facs="tcp:155189:41"/>them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.20. Hence I gather fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> their own expo≈øition, thus, that although they do as Chri≈øt did who lived 30 years before that he was baptized, &amp; al that time have bin taught to reform their lives, yet by their own expo≈øitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> they mu≈øt not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve &amp; do what Chri≈øt here commands them till they be baptized, becau≈øe ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; reformation are ≈øet downe after bapti≈øme in this place. Then ≈øeeing they fall thus foule upon their own expo≈øition, that they mu≈øt not ob≈øerve &amp; practi≈øe till they be baptized, in my judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t it were good to have the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> baptized betime, that they may begin reformation betime, that they may not only be taught 20 or 30 years, but they may ob≈øerve and practi≈øe what they have been taught. But here all may ≈øee what unprofitable hearers they make of their children, who ≈øhall heare before bapti≈øme, becau≈øe that teaching is ≈øet downe fir≈øt, but they mu≈øt not ob≈øerve and practi≈øe till after bapti≈øme becau≈øe that is ≈øet down la≈øt, neither will they baptize them that they may ob≈øerve and practi≈øe. Here I may repeat againe what I ≈øaid before, that the Apo≈øtles were ≈øent among≈øt heathens that are out of the Covenant, but we are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians in the Covenant; and they were men of age, but ours are Infants not capable of teaching. But do they ≈øtand ≈øo much upon this, that teaching is ≈øet down fir≈øt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ob≈øervation be ≈øet down after bapti≈ømein the ≈øame place? then let us to this joyn another, <hi>Io.</hi> 3.5. ≈øee <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. where Chri≈øt doth not ≈øay <hi>except ye be born of the ≈øpirit fir≈øt, and then of water afterwards, ye cannot enter into the Kingdome of heaven;</hi> but contrary he ≈øaith, <hi>except ye be borne of water, and then of the ≈øpirit,</hi> ≈øhewing that bapti≈øme mu≈øt give them admittance into the vi≈øible Church of God here, and they mu≈øt be borne of the ≈øpirit, that is, regenerated, before that they can come into God heavenly Kingdom, and we know that many were baptized before that they had the gifts and graces of the holy Gho≈øt given them, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.16.17. Again, they being ≈øent to teach tho≈øe that were capable of teaching, &amp; then to baptize them; but will it follow hence that Infants mu≈øt be fir≈øt taught and then baptized? becau≈øe <hi>Abraham</hi> was ninety and nine yeares old when he was circumci≈øed, mu≈øt <hi>I≈øaac</hi> be ≈øo too? a pretty conclu≈øion. But I have an≈øwered it already, and proved it too weak an argument to debar Infants born of Chri≈øtians from the ≈øeale of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øme: but further let me cleare this by a ≈øimilitude, the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <hi>this we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you, that if any will not worke, neither ≈øhould they eat,</hi> 2 The≈ø. 3.10. will they hence conclude that the Apo≈øtle will ≈øuffer none to eat but ≈øuch as worke? then what ≈øhall our aged people and Infants doe, and our ≈øick and weak and lame peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doe? ≈øhall we ≈øtarve them all becau≈øe they cannot worke? this is our Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øts divinity, who make that a generall rule for all, which is ≈øpoken only of ≈øome; for (≈øay they) becau≈øe men of yeares mu≈øt be in≈øtructed before they be baptized, therefore Infants mu≈øt be ≈øo too, and becau≈øe men growne &amp; in health and ≈øtrength mu≈øt worke or el≈øe they mu≈øt not eat, therefore infants mu≈øt doe ≈øo too, or el≈øe they mu≈øt not eat. Now for the example of Chri≈øt, who they ≈øay was not baptized till he was 30 years of age, I hope they will not ≈øay that he wanted fitne≈ø≈øe till he was of that age to be baptized, for <hi>when be was but twelve yeares old he disputed with the Doctors in the Teme, pl and all that heard him were a≈øtoni≈øhed at his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding
<pb facs="tcp:155189:41"/>and an≈øwers,</hi> Luke 2.42.46.47. Then the rea≈øon why Chri≈øt was not baptized till the middle of mans age or till he was 30 years of age, was, becau≈øe he was minded then with his Doctrine to in≈øtitute bapti≈øme; and that he might procure the greater authority to his in≈øtitution, he ≈øanctified it with his owne body, who was baptized to ≈øanctifie that ordinance unto us, <hi>and he ≈øent out his Apo≈øtles to baptize all Nations in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy Gho≈øt,</hi> Mat. 28. <hi>Though Ie≈øus him≈øelfe baptized not,</hi> meaning with water, becau≈øe (≈øaith <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bapti≈øt) <hi>he that commeth after me ≈øhall baptize you with the holy Gho≈øt,</hi> Mat 3.11. Thus Chri≈øt did then to many, as al≈øo now when he make to that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance effectuall to the clean≈øing of their foules from ≈øin; but if they ≈øtand ≈øo much upon the thirtieth yeare, why then did they ≈øuffer <hi>Gervetus</hi> one of their great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters to begin at the age of one and twenty years to boa≈øt of him≈øelfe to be a prophet? and they ≈øuffered him to take the place of a teacher before that he had been a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Church.</p>
               <p n="16">16, they object, that if Infants be baptized, they may a≈øwell receive the Lords Supper: I an≈øwer, no, that will not follow, for the Scriptures ≈øhew us a large difference betweene tho≈øe two; bapti≈øme is a ≈øigne of admi≈ø≈øion whereby they are numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people of God; &amp; it is a ≈øigne of ≈øpirituall regeneration, whereby wee are born again the children of God, whereas on the other ≈øide the Lords Supper is given to men growne in years, and therefore able to beare ≈øtronger meat; and whereas the Scripture never ≈øaith that any infants born of chri≈øtian parents are unfit for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øme, yet none mu≈øt receive the Lords Supper but ≈øuch as di≈øcerne the body and blood of the Lord, and are able to examine their owne con≈øcience, and able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Lords death; the Apo≈øtle exhorteth that <hi>every man ≈øhould prove and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him≈øelfe and then eat of that bread and drinke of that cup;</hi> therefore examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mu≈øt go before, which were a vaine thing to looke for from infants: againe, <hi>he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to him≈øelfe, not di≈øcerning the Lords body.</hi> But if none can partake worthily but they that can di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Lords body, why then ≈øhould we give to our tender children poy≈øon in ≈øtead of lively food?

               <p>Thirdly, it may be demanded whether the children of prophane and wicked pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents who hold the true religion in their judgement, but deny it in their lives, may the children of ≈øuch be baptized? I an≈øw. They may for all that: for without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>they that were of circumci≈øed lewes were circumci≈øed,</hi> Gen. 12.23.

               <p>Fourthly, It may be demanded whether children of excommunicate parents may be baptized.

               <p n="5">5. It may be demanded whether the intention of him that baptizeth be nece≈ø≈øary; I an≈øwer, if the word of in≈øtitution come to the element, it is a Sacrament, what≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Mini≈øters intention be. <hi>Paul rejoyced that Chri≈øt was preached, although many preached of envy &amp; contention, with no de≈øire of any good to their hearers,</hi> Phil. 1.16.

               <p n="6">6. It may be demanded what is the duty of the Mini≈øter in baptizing. I an≈øw. he ≈øtands in the room of God, &amp; what he doth according to the in≈øtitution, is as much
<pb facs="tcp:155189:42"/>as if God him≈øelf had done it with his own hand, and therefore when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter doth apply water to the body which is the ≈øigne and pledge of grace, he doth withall apply the promi≈øe of remi≈ø≈øion and life everla≈øting to the party baptized, &amp; that is as much as if God ≈øhould ≈øay to the party baptized, calling him by his name, I freely give unto thee the pardon of all thy ≈øins, and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verla≈øting, upon condition that thou keepe the order ≈øet downe in bapti≈øme, which is to turne unto me, and to beleeve in Chri≈øt; then here is ground for a ≈øpeciall ≈øaith. Fir≈øt, God for his part by hand of the Mini≈øter applyes the promi≈øe of mercy to every particular beleever; then againe, every particular beleever is by a ≈øpeciall faith to receive the promi≈øe. For when God ≈øhall ≈øpeake unto us particularly, and as it were a≈ø≈øure us of his mercies with his owne hand and ≈øeale; we mu≈øt needs be moved in our obedience to his will, and our hearts mu≈øt be affected with it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It may be demanded whether bapti≈øme admini≈øtred by wicked men or Hereticks or ≈øuch as cannot preach, be lawfull and true bapti≈øme. I an≈øwer, if ≈øuch a one be cho≈øen and put in the place of a true Pa≈øtor, and keepe the true forme of baptizing according to the In≈øtitution in the name of the Father, Son, and holy Gho≈øt, it is true bapti≈øme: but if they baptize in the name of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is unlawfull; for were ye baptized in the name of <hi>Paul? I thanke God I baptized none of you, le≈øt any ≈øhould ≈øay that I baptized in my owne name,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.13.14, 15. The≈øe things con≈øidered, although they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and could not preach, or wicked Hereticks that did admini≈øter it, yet their bapti≈øme was lawfull. For the Phari≈øees and Doctors of the Jewes were many of them not of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> but of ≈øome other Tribes, and many of them were Hereticks and Apo≈øtates, yet they were in the place of good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtors, and ≈øate in <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> Chaire, and taught ≈øome of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> doctrine; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øaith Chri≈øt, heare them.</p>

To this I an≈øwer, that they may not be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed againe, being once baptized; the efficacy of bapti≈øme extends it ≈øelfe to the whole life of man, and we are but once new borne, and once ingrafted into Chri≈øt, and the gift of regeneration is never extingui≈øhed; if a man could be borne againe, he ≈øhould need to be bapti≈øed againe, becau≈øe that bapti≈øme is the Sacrament of Inci≈øion or ingrafting.

Eighthly, hee ≈øaith, it is mon≈øtrous that a man after he is borne ≈øhould not eat: I an≈øwer, the ≈øoule may be fed although they doe not eat outwardly of the ≈øupper; Chri≈øt is meat to infants though they ab≈øtaine from the ≈øigne, which is the ≈øupper; but of bapti≈øme the ca≈øe is otherwi≈øe, for by it alone the gate into the Church is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to them. Ninthly, he ≈øaith, a good ≈øteward di≈øtributeth meat to his hou≈øhold in due time: I grant it, but then withal let him prove that bapti≈øme is given to infants out of due time. Tenthly, he bringeth the commandement of Chri≈øt, <hi>to make ha≈øte into the harve≈øt, for the fields are already white,</hi> John 4.35. I an≈øwer, from this place Chri≈øt would have his Apo≈øtles to take notice of the pre≈øent fruit and good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe of their labours, that they may the more cheerefully prepare them≈øelves to teach becau≈øe they were fitted to heare; but I ≈øay againe, what doth this concerne Infants to keep them from bapti≈øme?</p>
               <p n="11">11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> rea≈øon, he ≈øaith, in the fir≈øt Church Chri≈øtians and di≈øciples were all one: It is true, tho≈øe that were converted and baptized were both Di≈øciples
<pb facs="tcp:155189:44"/>and Chri≈øtians; but what of this? will he gather hence, that infants borne of Chri≈øtians are ≈øtrangers and out of the Covenant? let him prove it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. He alledgeth that all Chri≈øtians are brethren, but infants are out of this number ≈øo long as we debar them from the ≈øupper: I an≈øwer, Infants are heirs of the Kingdome of Heaven; <hi>for of ≈øuch is the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 19.14.18.14. <hi>And they are members of Chri≈øt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. And the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of Chri≈øt was a true token of their adoption, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.15. Thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are joyned in common with full growne men; therefore although they ab≈øtaine from the ≈øupper for a time, it hinders not, but that they pertaine to the body of the Church.</p>
               <p n="13">13. He addeth that none is made our brother, but by the ≈øpirit of adoption which is given only by the hearing of faith; this objection hath been often an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered, that it is ≈øpoken of men of yeares which is not required in Infants: this hearing of faith, but is this ≈øufficient to prove that God neither will, nor can bring home any of his elect, but by the ordinary meanes of the Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched? ≈øhall we ≈øhut all the world out of heaven, becau≈øe they have not this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes of ≈øalvation as we have? why then ≈øhall we limit the holy one of I≈ørael, as though he were not able to graft Infants into Chri≈øt by his ≈øpirit, becau≈øe the manner how is hidden from us.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Hee objecteth that <hi>Gornelius</hi> was <hi>baptized after hee had received the holy Gho≈øt,</hi> Acts 10. But what of this, becau≈øe one was ≈øo, mu≈øt all be ≈øo? I have ≈øhewed the contrary by many examples, read <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15.16.17. The holy Gho≈øt was faln upon none of them; <hi>Yet they were baptized in the name of the Lord Ie≈øus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. Here this bla≈øphemer ≈øaith, by regeneration we are made Gods, and that they be Gods to whom the word of God is ≈øpoken; This, ≈øaith he, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not to children that be Infants. All that I will ≈øay at this time to this damnable errour, is this, to ≈øhew their helli≈øh inference from ≈øome places where Kings and Magi≈øtrates by rea≈øon of their offices are called Gods, being his Vice-gerents or Deputies upon earth. Hence they would gather that all the ≈øaithfull are deified that they may the better bani≈øh Infants out of the Church.</p>
               <p n="16">16. He ≈øaith that Infants cannot be accounted new men, becau≈øe they have not been begotten by the word. This I have often an≈øwered to belong to men of yeares, yet Gods ≈øpirit can worke without the ordinary meanes.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Here he brings another allegory, ≈øaying, in the Law a ≈øheep &amp; a goate were not offered in ≈øacrifice as ≈øoone as they came out of the wombe. Here I might an≈øwer, <hi>that the fir≈øt born of man and bea≈øt was con≈øecrated to the Lord as ≈øoon as it came out of the wombe,</hi> Exod. 13.2.</p>
               <p n="18">18. He affirmeth that none can come to Chri≈øt but they that have beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepared of <hi>Iohn.</hi> I an≈øwer, had tho≈øe Infants beene with <hi>Iohn</hi> whom Chri≈øt embraced and ble≈ø≈øed? away with ≈øuch fal≈øe principles.</p>
               <p n="19">
                  <pb facs="tcp:155189:44"/> 19. Here he calleth for Patrons, ≈øuch as <hi>Tri≈ømegi≈øtus</hi> and the <hi>Sibylls,</hi> to prove that holy wa≈øhing pertaine to none but them that are grown of age: here this man di≈øcovers his honourable e≈øteeme of the bapti≈øme of Chri≈øt, who will reduce it to the Ceremonies of the Gentiles, that it may be no otherwi≈øe admini≈øtred then plea≈øeth <hi>Tri≈ømegi≈øtus,</hi> but we more e≈øteem the authority of God, whom it hath plea≈øed to make Infants holy to him≈øelfe, and to admit them with that holy ≈øigne, the force whereof they did not yet under≈øtand: neither do we count it lawfull to borrow any thing out of the clean≈øings of the Gentiles, that may change in our bapti≈øme the everla≈øting &amp; inviolable law of God which he hath e≈øtabli≈øhed concerning circumci≈øion.</p>
               <p n="20">20. La≈øt of all he maketh this argument, that if it be lawfull to baptize In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants without under≈øtanding, that bapti≈øme like an interlude may be in ≈øport admini≈øtred of boyes when they play. But of this matter let him quarrell with God, by who≈øe commandement Circumci≈øion was common to Infants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they had attained to under≈øtanding: was it therefore a thing to bee played with, or ≈øubject to the follies of Children, that they might overthrow that holy ordinance of God? but it is no marvaile that tho≈øe reprobate ≈øpirits although they were vexed with frenzie, do thru≈øt in all the gro≈ø≈øe≈øt ab≈øurdities for defence of their errors, becau≈øe God doth with ≈øuch giddine≈ø≈øe ju≈øtly take vengeance of their pride and ≈øtubbornne≈ø≈øe. So much for the 20. arguments of <hi>Servetus,</hi> and his brethren the <hi>Anabapti≈øts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One objection I find ≈øince which is this, that Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne all that they baptized to make profe≈ø≈øion that they had ju≈øtifying faith, although they had it not. I an. Chri≈øt ≈øaid, <hi>≈øome of you beleeve not, for Ie≈øus knew who they were that beleeved not,</hi> John 6.64.66. And the Apo≈øtles ≈øay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øelves that the holy Gho≈øt was faln upon none of tho≈øe in <hi>Samaria, yet they were baptized in the name of the Lord Ie≈øus,</hi> Acts 8.16. Then ≈øhall we think that Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles would enjoyne them to make profe≈ø≈øion of a lye, to ≈øay they have ju≈øtifying faith when they had it not? or did Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles engage them≈øelves to beleeve that the baptized had ju≈øtifying faith, when they knew the contrary, and ≈øo beleeve a lye again≈øt their owne con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? But they di≈øplay their folly and reply, ≈øaying, the knowledge of Chri≈øt was above the rule, and therefore he might cau≈øe them to make profe≈ø≈øion of a ju≈øtifying faith, though he knew they had it not; but what bla≈øphemy is this to make Chri≈øt the author of their di≈ø≈øembling? and not only ≈øo, but a de≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler him≈øelfe, to profe≈ø≈øe that they had ju≈øtifying faith, which, ≈øay our <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øts,</hi> was the cau≈øe of bapti≈øme, when he knew they had it not? Hence we may gather that knowledge of ≈øin gives free toleration of ≈øinne; for Chr≈øt knew they had no ju≈øtifying faith, yet he might baptize them. But this is no rule, ≈øay our <hi>Anabapti≈øts,</hi> for other Mini≈øters, becau≈øe they do not know that they have no ju≈øtifying ≈øaith, as Chri≈øt did; ≈øo then by the doctrine of <hi>Anabapti≈øts,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:155189:45"/>if our Mini≈øters know that Infants have no faith, they may baptize them; but if they doe not know that they have no ju≈øtifying faith, then they mu≈øt not baptize them.</p>
               <p>Now all ≈øober-minded men may ≈øee how ra≈øhly they trouble the Church of Chri≈øt with brawls and contentions for baptizing of Infants; but it will be profitable to con≈øider what Satan goeth about with this ≈øo great ≈øubtilty, even to take away from us the ≈øingular fruit of affiance and ≈øpiritual joy (which is to be gathered hereof) and to dimini≈øh al≈øo the glory of the goodne≈ø≈øe of God: for ≈øweet it is to godly minds to be certified not onely by word, but al≈øo by ≈øight to our eyes of the great favour that we have obtained of our heavenly father both to us and our po≈øterity. How ≈øhould this ≈øtirre up thankfulne≈ø≈øe, that God is not only in Covenant with us, but with our ≈øeed after us? this thanke≈øgiving and prai≈øe unto our God for this mercy, is the thing that Satan ≈øeeks to hinder by depriving our Infants of this ordinance of bapti≈øme. Now if Satan could hinder this a≈ø≈øurance of the grace of God to our Po≈øterity, he would ≈øoone ≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle all the promi≈øes that ever God made to us and our po≈øterity after us in his word: hence would follow in ≈øtead thereof, unthankfulne≈ø≈øe and ≈øloathfulne≈ø≈øe to in≈øtruct our children in godline≈ø≈øe; for what encouragement have we more then this, to bring them up in the feare of God. when we con≈øider that even immediately from their birth the Lord taketh and acknowledgeth them for his Children. Oh then let us labour to ≈øee the bountifull goodne≈ø≈øe of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and let us offer to him our children, who will give them a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that be in his family and hou≈øhold of faith, yea he will make them members of his Church and heires of his everla≈øting Kingdome. Then what heart can be ≈øo cruell to debar his litle Infants from the ordinance of bapti≈øme, which is the doore of entrance to all the mercies of God both here and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 102.28. For (≈øaith <hi>Luke</hi>) <hi>all the people that heard him and the publicans ju≈øtified God, being baptized with the bapti≈øme of</hi> John; <hi>But the Phari≈øees and Lawyers rejected the coun≈øell of God again≈øt them≈øelves. being not baptized of him,</hi> Luke 7.29.30.</p>
